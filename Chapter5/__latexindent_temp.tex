\chapter{A hydrogen impurity measurement device for measuring ISO 14687 impurities}

\section{Abstract}
In this chapter a device capable of performing hydrogen impurity enrichment is designed and tested under a number of conditions using a commercial membrane compared against the best performing fabricated membranes in chapter 5. The aim of this chapter is to improve upon the designs in literature to provide a more efficient, A sample was taken from a commercial hydrogen refuelling station, spiked with krypton, and enriched using the device in order to validate the krypton tracer enrichment method using real world conditions, and to quantify the impurity concentrations present in commercial hydrogen fuel.

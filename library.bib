abstract = "We studied the degradation and durability of polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) at membrane-electrode-assembly (MEA) level by injection of octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane (D4) as a representative siloxane, which has been found in many industrial and personal products. Specifically, i) GC/MS analysis demonstrated that the ring-opening polymerization of D4 could result in the formation of various linear and cyclic siloxanes in both electrodes of MEA; ii) post-test analysis revealed that the transformed siloxanes were transported from the anode to the cathode via free-volumes in the polymer membrane; iii) RDE measurement and DFT calculation revealed that D4 was not directly responsible for the electrocatalytic activity of Pt; iv) electrochemical analysis demonstrated that the residual methyl groups of siloxane and various siloxanes did not hinder the proton transport in the polymer membrane; and v) siloxanes accumulated in the primary and secondary pores with the exception of an external surface of carbon, causing an increase in the oxygen reactant's resistance and resulting in a decrease of the cell performance. In addition, we confirmed that injection of D4 did not affect the carbon corrosion adversely because the siloxane had little influence on water sorption in the catalyst layer."

abstract = "While Liquid Organic Hydrogen Carrier (LOHC) systems offer a very promising way of infrastructure-compatible storage and transport of hydrogen, the hydrogen quality released from charged LOHC compounds by catalytic dehydrogenation has been a surprisingly rarely discussed topic to date. This contribution deals, therefore, with a detailed analysis of the hydrogen purity released from the hydrogen-rich Liquid Organic Hydrogen Carrier compound perhydro dibenzyltoluene (H18-DBT). We demonstrate, that high purity hydrogen (>99.999%) with carbon monoxide levels below 0.2 ppmv can be obtained from the dehydrogenation of H18-DBT if the applied H18-DBT had been carefully pre-dried and pre-purified prior to the dehydrogenation experiment. Indeed, the largest part of relevant impurities to comply with the hydrogen quality standard for fuel cells in road vehicles (ISO 14687-2) was found to originate from water and oxygenate impurities present in the applied, technical LOHC qualities."

abstract  ="First-principles calculations represent a potent tool for screening metal hydride mixtures that can reversibly store hydrogen. A number of promising new hydride systems with high hydrogen capacity and favorable thermodynamics have been predicted this way. An important limitation of these studies{,} however{,} is the assumption that H2 is the only gas-phase product of the reaction{,} which is not always the case. This paper summarizes new theoretical and numerical approaches that can be used to predict thermodynamic equilibria in complex metal hydride systems with competing reaction pathways. We report thermochemical equilibrium calculations using data obtained from density functional theory (DFT) computations to describe the possible occurrence of gas-phase products other than H2 in three complex hydrides{,} LiNH2{,} LiBH4{,} and Mg(BH4)2{,} and mixtures of these with the destabilizing compounds LiH{,} MgH2{,} and C. The systems under investigation contain N{,} C{,} and/or B and thus have the potential to evolve N2{,} NH3{,} hydrocarbons{,} and/or boranes as well as H2. Equilibria as a function of both temperature and total pressure are predicted. The results indicate that significant amounts of these species can form under some conditions. In particular{,} the thermodynamic model predicts formation of N2 and NH3 as products of LiNH2 decomposition. Comparison with published experimental data indicates that N2 formation must be kinetically limited. Our examination of C-containing systems indicates that methane is the stable gas-phase species at low temperatures{,} not H2. On the other hand{,} very low amounts of boranes (primarily BH3) are predicted to form in B-containing systems."}

	abstract = {Reformate hydrogen contains many impurities, some are well known while others have been less studied. Hydrocarbons are possible impurities in reformate hydrogen and are among those less studied. This study if aimed at alkenes, with special focus on propene. Adsorption and desorption on the Pt catalyst is studied using stripping cyclic voltammetry combined with mass spectrometry. The results show that although the effect of propene in the presence of hydrogen is expected to be minimal, adsorption and blockage of catalytic sites cannot be ruled out. A small amount of ad-species is formed on Pt at low adsorption potentials, and in the presence of hydrogen, although suppression of the hydrogen desorption peak was minimal if hydrogen was adsorbed on the Pt catalyst prior to exposure.}

abstract = "Alternatives in biofuels today include three main sources of renewable energy derived from biomass: biodiesel, bioethanol, and biogas. Biofuels can be first generation (produced from food crops; using sugars, starches, and vegetable oils) or second generation (produced from all forms of lignocellulosic biomass) fuels. Renewable energy production from energy crops and agricultural or industrial waste or wastewater; for example, crops and agricultural residues, domestic wastewater, industrial wastewater, sewage sludge, and animal manure, is a viable solution because it provides the correct destination for various types of waste and facilitates energy production. This chapter presents an overview of biogas production, as well as applications for an efficient bioenergy recovery from anaerobic systems. Aspects regarding renewable energy sources, anaerobic processes, and biogas production, including some characteristics of biogas purification and upgrading, are presented. Overall, this text compiles critical information to better understand the potential of anaerobic biodigestion as a robust processing step for bioenergy production."

The greatest impact on improving gas-to-liquids plant economics is to decrease capital costs associated with syngas production and improve thermal efficiency through better heat integration and utilization. Improved thermal efficiency can be obtained by combining the gas-to-liquids plant with a power generation plant to take advantage of the availability of low-pressure steam. This chapter presents the means by which synthesis gas and hydrogen are produced from carbonaceous feedstocks."

This article provides a review of the material and process considerations for catalytic ammonia decomposition and shows that Ru-based catalysts on conductive support materials are active at < 500 °C, but further understanding around lifetimes and deactivation conditions is required. This review then explores materials and technologies for hydrogen purification from decomposed ammonia gas streams, and our experiments show that defect-free dense-metal membranes are uninhibited by ammonia and can achieve the required product purity."

@article{Liguori2014a,
abstract = {The present work is focused on the investigation of the performance and long-term stability of two composite palladium membranes under different operating conditions. One membrane (Pd/porous stainless steel (PSS)) is characterized by a {\~{}}10 microm-thick palladium layer on a porous stainless steel substrate, which is pretreated by means of surface modification and oxidation; the other membrane (Pd/Al2O3) is constituted by a {\~{}}7 microm-thick palladium layer on an asymmetric microporous Al2O3 substrate. The operating temperature and pressure ranges, used for studying the performance of these two kinds of membranes, are 350-450 degrees C and 200-800 kPa, respectively. The H2 permeances and the H2/N2 selectivities of both membranes were investigated and compared with literature data. At 400 degrees C and 200 kPa as pressure difference, Pd/PSS and Pd/Al2O3 membranes exhibited an H2/N2 ideal selectivity equal to 11700 and 6200, respectively, showing stability for 600 h. Thereafter, H2/N2 selectivity of both membranes progressively decreased and after around 2000 h, dropped dramatically to 55 and 310 for the Pd/PSS and Pd/Al2O3 membranes, respectively. As evidenced by Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) analyses, the pinholes appear on the whole surface of the Pd/PSS membrane and this is probably due to release of sulphur from the graphite seal rings.},

All of the membranes, coated by palladium to provide activity to hydrogen dissociation and recombination, were sufficiently robust in a hydrogen atmosphere and showed stable permeability only to hydrogen at least in the range of 473-573K. On the other hand, over 573K, the permeation rate slowly decreased over time. Permeability was found to decrease with Hf substitute amount for Zr mainly due to increase in activation energy for permeation. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

Sulfur forms strong bonds with all the surfaces and favors hollow sites in every case. The binding energies on the pure metals show considerable variation and follow the trend: Ebind(Pd(111))>Ebind(Cu(111))>Ebind(Ag(111)). On the alloy surfaces, the adsorption energies in general are weaker in comparison to adsorption on the Pd(111) surface but the reduction in binding is not large. The strong interaction of sulfur with these surfaces arises from rehybridization of the p-states of the adsorbate with the substrate sp- and d-bands. We confirm that there is nearly a linear correlation between the binding energies of S on similar adsorption sites and the d-band center of surface atoms whose structure remain close to their bulk-truncated position."

abstract = {The (Ni/sub 0.6/Nb/sub 0.4/)/sub 45/Zr/sub 50/X/sub 5 /(X=Al, Co, Cu, P, Pd, Si, Sn, Ta or Ti) alloy ribbons were produced by the melt-spinning technique. All ribbon specimens were confirmed to have a single amorphous phase by XRD analysis. The crystallization temperature of the melt-spun (Ni/sub 0.6/Nb/sub 0.4 /)/sub 45/Zr/sub 50/X/sub 5/(X=Al, P, Pd, Si or Sn) amorphous alloys are higher than that of the (Ni/sub 0.6/Nb/sub 0.4 /)/sub 50/Zr/sub 50/ amorphous alloy (727 K). Although the hydrogen permeability of the (Ni/sub 0.6/Nb/sub 0.4/)/sub 45/Zr/sub 50/X/sub 5 /(X=Si, Sn, Ta or Ti) amorphous alloys could not be measured due to severe embrittlement during the permeation test, the (Ni/sub 0.6/Nb /sub 0.4/)/sub 45/Zr/sub 50/X/sub 5/(X=Al, Co, Cu, P or Pd) amorphous alloys had high ductility which was enough to measure the permeability. The hydrogen permeabilities of the (Ni/sub 0.6/Nb /sub 0.4/)/sub 45/Zr/sub 50/Co/sub 5/ and the (Ni /sub 0.6/Nb/sub 0.4/)/sub 45/Zr/sub 50/Cu/sub 5 / amorphous alloys were 2.46*10/sup -8/ and 2.34*10/sup -8/[mol middot m/sup -1/ middot s/sup -1 / middot Pa/sup -1/2/] at 673 K, respectively. The (Ni/sub 0.6 /Nb/sub 0.4/)/sub 45/Zr/sub 50/P/sub 5/ amorphous alloy possesses the lowest permeability of 1.36*10/sup -8/(mol middot m/sup -1/ middot s/sup -1 / middot Pa-1/2] at 673 K among the alloys where the permeability was measured. The reduction of the permeability in the (Ni/sub 0.6/Nb/sub 0.4/)/sub 45/Zr/sub 50/P/sub 5 / amorphous alloy is thought to be due to the preferential formation of Zr-P atomic pairs which may suppress the hydrogen solubility and hydrogen diffusivity in the alloy. Since the heat of mixing for Zr-P atomic pairs is negatively larger than that for other pairs such as Ni-P and Nb-P. It is concluded that the Ni-Nb-Zr-X(X=Co or Cu) amorphous alloys have high potential to hydrogen permeable membranes.},

abstract = {We examined the hydrogen permeation of a melt-spun Zr60Al15Co2.5Ni7.5Cu15glassy alloy. The hydrogen flow increased with increasing temperature or difference in the square-roots of hydrogen pressures across the membrane, $\Delta$p. At higher temperature or higher hydrogen pressure difference, the hydrogen flow is proportional to $\Delta$p. It is therefore interpreted that the diffusion through the membrane is a rate-controlling factor for the hydrogen permeation in this alloy. The hydrogen permeability of the Zr60Al15Co2.5Ni7.5Cu15glassy alloy was measured to be 1.13×10-8(mol/(msPa1/2)) at 673K, which is as high as that of pure Pd metal. The present result demonstrates the possibility of future practical use of the glassy alloys as a hydrogen permeable membrane. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {We present an investigation of molecular permeation of gases through nanoporous graphene membranes via molecular dynamics simulations; four different gases are investigated, namely helium, hydrogen, nitrogen, and methane. We show that in addition to the direct (gas-kinetic) flux of molecules crossing from the bulk phase on one side of the graphene to the bulk phase on the other side, for gases that adsorb onto the graphene, significant contribution to the flux across the membrane comes from a surface mechanism by which molecules cross after being adsorbed onto the graphene surface. Our results quantify the relative contribution of the bulk and surface mechanisms and show that the direct flux can be described reasonably accurately using kinetic theory, provided the latter is appropriately modified assuming steric molecule-pore interactions, with gas molecules behaving as hard spheres of known kinetic diameters. The surface flux is negligible for gases that do not adsorb onto graphene (e.g., He and H2), while for gases that adsorb (e.g., CH4 and N2) it can be on the order of the direct flux or larger. Our results identify a nanopore geometry that is permeable to hydrogen and helium, is significantly less permeable to nitrogen, and is essentially impermeable to methane, thus validating previous suggestions that nanoporous graphene membranes can be used for gas separation. We also show that molecular permeation is strongly affected by pore functionalization; this observation may be sufficient to explain the large discrepancy between simulated and experimentally measured transport rates through nanoporous graphene membranes.},

abstract = {superhydrophobic surfaces can be used to reduce the minimum voltage and to increase the maximum speed under certain conditions, but there are some harmful side-effects. First of all, the electrostatic pressure can push water into the surface pores, which hinders actuation. The phenomenon can also be treated as a vertical electrowetting effect. Another drawback is that the use of superhydrophobic surfaces makes actuation more critical to the properties of the liquid. For example, actuation of biological buffer solutions was not successful. For these reasons, it is concluded that it is more beneficial to use a smooth surface with low hysteresis than a superhydrophobic surface in droplet actuation. Electrostatic droplet actuation is a potential method for manipulating liquid on a microscopic scale, but there is still work to do. This work contains a detailed examination of the droplet actuation mechanism, and trapping of charges in the solid-liquid interface is found to be the most severe problem that needs to be solved.},

abstract = {In this study, hydrogen selective membranes have been fabricated using microsystem technology. A 750 nm dense layer of Pd (77 wt{\%}) and Ag (23 wt{\%}) is deposited on a non-porous 1 mm thick silicon nitride layer by cosputtering of a Pd and a Ag target. After sputtering, openings of 5 ??m are made in the silicon nitride layer to create a clear passage to the Pd/Ag surface. As a result of the production method, these membranes are pinhole free and have a low resistance to mass transfer in the gas phase, as virtually no support layer is present. The membranes have been tested in a gas permeation system to determine the hydrogen permeability as a function of temperature, gas flow rate, and feed composition. In addition, the hydrogen selectivity over helium has been determined, which appears to be above 1500. At 0.2 bar partial hydrogen pressure in the feed, the hydrogen permeability of the membranes has been found to range from 0.02 to 0.95 mol.H2/m2xs at 350 and 450??C, respectively. It is expected that by improving the hydrodynamics and increasing the operation temperature, substantially higher fluxes will be attainable.},

abstract = {Palladium-platinum (Pd-Pt) alloy membranes have been fabricated by sequential, electroless deposition onto porous yttria-stablized zirconia supports manufactured by Praxair, Inc. Membranes were synthesized with thicknesses of 4-12??m that contained up to 27wt{\%} Pt. Pd-Pt alloy membranes had lower pure-gas hydrogen flux compared with pure Pd membranes of equal thickness. However, when tested at 673K under an identical synthetic water-gas shift feed gas mixture composed of H2, H2O, CO2, and CO at 689.5kPa total pressure, the Pd-Pt alloy membranes had over 25{\%} higher hydrogen fluxes than a pure Pd membrane of similar thickness. Membrane films were analyzed after testing with SEM, EDS, and ICP-AES to corroborate membrane thickness and alloy compositions estimated by mass gain. SEM thickness estimates on membrane cross sections were similar to those estimated by mass gain. ICP-AES analysis was performed on two membranes and confirmed the composition estimated by gravimetric analysis. In five of six membranes the film composition estimated by gravimetric analysis was consistent with the surface composition estimated by EDS which indicated that the membranes had been adequately annealed. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {We prepared the melt-spun (Ni0.6Nb0.4)100−xZrx (x=0 to 40 at{\%}) and other amorphous alloy membranes and examined the permeation of hydrogen through those alloy membranes. The interatomic spacing in the Ni–Nb–Zr amorphous structure increased with increasing Zr content. The crystallization temperature of the Ni–Nb–Zr amorphous alloys decreased with increasing Zr content. The hydrogen flow increased with an increase of the temperature or the difference in the square-roots of hydrogen pressures across the membrane, $\Delta$$\backslash$$\backslash$sqrtp. At relatively higher temperature up to 673 K or at relatively higher hydrogen pressure difference, $\Delta$$\backslash$$\backslash$sqrtp up to 550 Pa1⁄2, the hydrogen flow was more strictly proportional to $\Delta$$\backslash$$\backslash$sqrtp. This indicates that the diffusion of hydrogen through the membrane is a rate-controlling factor for hydrogen permeation. The permeability of the Ni–Nb–Zr amorphous alloys was strongly dependent on alloy compositions and increased with increasing Zr content. However, it was difficult to investigate the hydrogen permeability of the (Ni0.6Nb0.4)60Zr40 amorphous alloy in this work due to the embrittlement during the measurement. The maximum hydrogen permeability was 1.3×10−8 (mol{\textperiodcentered}m−1{\textperiodcentered}s−1{\textperiodcentered}Pa−1⁄2) at 673 K for the (Ni0.6Nb0.4)70Zr30 amorphous alloy. It is noticed that the hydrogen permeability of the (Ni0.6Nb0.4)70Zr30 amorphous alloy is higher than that of pure Pd metal. These permeation characteristics indicate the possibility of future practical use of the melt-spun amorphous alloys as a hydrogen permeable membrane.},

Hydrogen permeation test showed that the membrane had a hydrogen permeation flux of 4.5 ?? 10-1 mol m-2 s-1 at a temperature of 773 K and a pressure difference of 100 kPa. The hydrogen permeability normalized value with thickness of the membrane was 1.4 times higher than our pure Pd membrane having similar structure.

abstract = {The electrostatic interaction between two adsorbates, and, in particular, between an adsorbed atom and an adsorbed or adsorbing molecule is studied. Based on self-consistent calculations of the electrostatic potential around a series of atoms outside a jellium surface, it is shown that a simple electrostatic interaction can explain a large number of experimental observations concerning the influence of pre-adsorbed atoms on the adsorption rate, stability and adsorption configuration of simple molecules on metal surfaces. The role of pre-adsorbed alkalis as promoters and of electronegative atoms like P, S, Cl and O as poisons for the adsorption of electron acceptor molecules like H2, O2, N2 and CO is discussed, as well as the relative magnitude of the influence of the alkalis and the electronegative atoms. The peculiar effects that pre-adsorbed atoms have on molecules like H2O and NH3 are ascribed to the large intra-molecular electron transfer in these molecules. {\textcopyright} 1985.},

As a proof-of-concept, we built an oxygen sensor for the A-Band at 760 nm. A VCSEL laser was used as a laser source due to its mode stability and reduced cost compared to DFB lasers and Fabry-Perot lasers. In order to reduce as much as possible the sensor size, a hollow waveguide is used to guide the light and the gas to be analysed in a long path to enhance the sensitivity of the sensor. Two different types of hollow fibres were characterised with respect to their suitability for gas sensing, a photonic crystal fibre, also known as micro-structured optical fibre, and hollow metal-coated capillaries. Characteristics as attenuation, spectral transmission properties and filling time were analysed. At the end, a sensor device with coupling and detection unit was developed. The main advantage of our set-up is the possibility of using the same design for different gases by changing solely the laser, the detector and the coupling lens.},

Two-dimensional nanostructured semiconducting metal oxide based gas sensors have also been recognized as successful gas detection devices. This review aims to provide the latest advancements in the field of gas sensors based on various two-dimensional materials with the main focus on sensor performance metrics such as sensitivity, specificity, detection limit, response time, and reversibility. Both experimental and theoretical studies on the gas sensing properties of graphene and other two-dimensional materials beyond graphene are also discussed. The article concludes with the current challenges and future prospects for two-dimensional materials in gas sensor applications.},

abstract = {Microstructures and hydrogen permeability (phi) of as-cast Nb-Ti-Ni alloys have been investigated by scanning, electron microscopy (SEM) and by the gas permeation technique, respectively. The phi value increases with increasing temperature and the amount of the Nb content for every alloy. In these alloys, the Nb39Ti31Ni30 alloy, consisting of the primary bcc-(Nb, Ti) solid solution and the eutectic {\{}(Nb, Ti)+TiNi{\}} phase, shows the highest phi, which is equivalent to that of Pd. On the other hand, the Nb10Ti50Ni40 alloy, consisting of the primary B2-TiNi compound and the eutectic {\{}(Nb, Ti)+TiNi{\}} phase, shows the lowest phi value among the alloys for which phi is measurable. Eutectic microstructures suppress the hydrogen embrittlement, while the primary (Nb, Ti) phase contributes to the hydrogen permeation in these alloys. The present work demonstrates that duplex alloys containing eutectic microstructures are promising for hydrogen permeation membranes with high resistance to the hydrogen embrittlement.},

Three different crystalline coordination polymers were synthesized using a solvothermal technique and were characterized using a variety of methods, including, single-crystal X-ray diffiraction, PXRD, TGA, IR spectroscopy, gas adsorption measurements, and luminescence measurements. The coordination polymer built from 1r-[3-(2-pyridyl)benzoate](3), 1, was found to be highly porous with a nitrogen BET surface area of 764 m(2)/g, whereas the coordination polymers built from Ir-[4-(2-pyridyl)benzoate](3), 2 and were nonporous. The (3)MLCT phosphorescence of each of the three coordination polymers was quenched in the presence of O(2). However, only 1 showed quick and reversible luminescence quenching by oxygen, whereas 2 and 3 exhibited gradual and irreversible luminescence quenching by oxygen. The high permanent porosity of 1 allows for rapid diffusion of oxygen through the open channels, leading to efficient and reversible quenching of the (3)MLCT phosphorescence. This work highlights the opportunity of designing highly porous and luminescent coordination polymers for sensing other important analytes.},

abstract = {Graphene oxide (GO) membranes have demonstrated great potential in gas separation and liquid filtration. For upscale applications, GO membranes in a hollow fibre geometry are of particular interest due to the high-efficiency and easy-assembly features at module level. However, GO membranes were found unstable in dry state on ceramic hollow fibre substrates, mainly due to the drying-related shrinkage, which has limited the applications and post-treatments of GO membranes. We demonstrate here that GO hollow fibre membranes can be stabilised by using a porous poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) sacrificial layer, which creates a space between the hollow fibre substrate and the GO membrane thus allowing stress-free shrinkage. Defect-free GO hollow fibre membrane was successfully determined and the membrane was stable in a long term (1200 hours) gas-tight stability test. Post-treatment of the GO membranes with UV light was also successfully accomplished in air, which induced the creation of controlled microstructural defects in the membrane and increased the roughness factor of the membrane surface. The permeability of the UV-treated GO membranes was greatly enhanced from 0.07 to 2.8 L m(-2) h(-1) bar(-1) for water, and 0.14 to 7.5 L m(-2) h(-1) bar(-1) for acetone, with an unchanged low molecular weight cut off ({\~{}}250 Da).},

Gas permeation of the membranes was examined at the temperature ranges at 100-300 °C. The hydrogen flux for the membranes of low Ag content gave a marked change giving a peak in the range of 170-200 °C, which was attributed to the {\$}\alpha{\$}-{\$}\beta{\$} crystal phase transition of the hydride. The peak in hydrogen flux became less significant and appears as shoulder along with the increase of silver content. This observation coincides with the decrease of lattice size difference between {\$}\alpha{\$} and {\$}\beta{\$} phase by the increase of Ag content in the Pd-Ag alloy. Improved durability of the alloy membrane (Ag {\{}{\textgreater}{\}} 20{\{}{\%}{\}}) was demonstrated by cyclic change of gas and temperature and was attributed to the suppression of lattice expansion by alloying with more than 20{\{}{\%}{\}} of silver. {\{}{\textcopyright}{\}} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The carbon molecular sieving membranes were prepared from the polymer blend of polyphenylene oxide (PPO) and polypyrrolidone (PVP) as thermally stable and labile polymer, respectively. The permeation results for the carbon membranes derived from the polymer blends of PPO/PVP showed that the transport of gas species was affected by the molecular sieving effect and that the permeation performances had a strong dependency upon the pyrolysis temperature and PVP molecular weight. The PPO/PVP derived carbon membranes with lower PVP molecular weight than 40 K showed decreased gas permeances and increased permselectivities due to decrease in the pore structure. Meanwhile, it was observed that gas permeance for the carbon membranes of higher molecular weights than 40 K increased due to the enhanced diffusional pathways in the thermally labile polymer region. It is considered that the introduction of the thermally labile polymer leads to control the pore structure through the permeation results for the carbon membrane derived from the PPO/PVP and that the permeation performance is affected by the molecular weight and pyrolysis temperature. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

It was found that the method was flexible and effective for combined control over the seed suspension concentration, seed size, and coating temperature, leading to combined control of properties of the seed layer over the seed size, thickness, coverage, and defect. A thin continuous, smooth defect-free asymmetric seed layer was achieved consisting of large and small zeolite T seed crystals.

However, the stream from steam methane reforming contains high contents of H2O, CO2, and CO, which poses crueler challenges to the chemical stability of Ni-BZCYYb membrane than dry H2 and CO2. In this work, we tested the Ni-BZCYYb membrane in wet H2 and CO2 which generated high content of H2O and CO due to reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction at high temperature. High content of H2O improves the proton conductivity of BZCYYb and hydrogen transport through the membrane. On the other hand, H2 content reduction and decomposition of BZCYYb promoted by high content of H2O lead to performance degradation. The steady-state hydrogen flux may increase or decrease depending on the balance among these effects. Besides, CO-induced Ni corrosion was found in both surface and bulk due to metal dusting. In general, Ni-BZCYYb membrane still displayed much better performance stability in wet H2 and CO2 than Ni-BaCe0.8Y0.2O3-$\delta$ and Ni-BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.2O3-$\delta$ composites, making it a candidate material system for further studies aimed at membrane processing of hydrocarbons. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

Transducers have improved greatly in sensitivity and compactness, but profitable matches with materials able to imbue them with suitable sensitivities have not always progressed at a similar pace. Pellistor-type sensors in particular have enjoyed dramatic degrees of miniaturization over the years, yet suffer nevertheless from the drawback of being broadly active to all combustible species - a legacy of the nonselective nature of combustion catalysis in general. This paper describes the effects of combustion catalyst-containing zeolites on the output signals of micromachined thin-film calorimeters, and demonstrates that sensitivity to different species can be notably altered depending on the nature (e.g. pore size) of the zeolite used. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = "The integrity of thin composite palladium membranes is influenced by the surface roughness of the porous support. Supports with smooth surface and small pore size are expensive as they are composed of several layers with decreasing pore size which require multiple successive energy and time consuming sintering steps. In addition, smooth surfaces may cause poor membrane adhesion. It is therefore of interest to develop methods for preparation of thin defect-free palladium membranes over supports with rough surfaces. Porous stainless steel tubes coated by atmospheric plasma spraying with a porous layer of yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) were used in this work as a support for palladium composite membranes. The YSZ layer served as a barrier against intermetallic diffusion between the palladium membrane and the metallic support. Three different techniques to create the membranes were compared: magnetron sputtering did not result in sufficiently dense films. Atmospheric plasma spraying produced relatively thick continuous films, but with some residual open porosity. Electroless plating gave the densest layers. Yet rather thick layers were required to limit the number of defects, which is associated with high cost and low hydrogen flux. Activation of the support surface by metal organic chemical vapor deposition of palladium instead of the conventional sensitization and activation pretreatment based on successive immersion in SnCl2 and PdCl2 solutions allowed to reduce the membrane thickness without compromising its integrity. The resulting membrane showed significantly higher permselectivity but at the same time decreased hydrogen permeability."

abstract = {superhydrophobic surfaces can be used to reduce the minimum voltage and to increase the maximum speed under certain conditions, but there are some harmful side-effects. First of all, the electrostatic pressure can push water into the surface pores, which hinders actuation. The phenomenon can also be treated as a vertical electrowetting effect. Another drawback is that the use of superhydrophobic surfaces makes actuation more critical to the properties of the liquid. For example, actuation of biological buffer solutions was not successful. For these reasons, it is concluded that it is more beneficial to use a smooth surface with low hysteresis than a superhydrophobic surface in droplet actuation. Electrostatic droplet actuation is a potential method for manipulating liquid on a microscopic scale, but there is still work to do. This work contains a detailed examination of the droplet actuation mechanism, and trapping of charges in the solid-liquid interface is found to be the most severe problem that needs to be solved.},

In this critical review we provide an overview of the current status of hydrogen storage within such compounds.

abstract = {Hydrogen permeation through SrCe1-xTbxO3-?? (x = 0.025, 0.05 and 0.10) membranes using various gas streams as the sweep was investigated. Hydrogen impermeable SrCe1-xTbxO3-?? membranes with air or inert gas in the downstream become hydrogen permeable when there is a reducing gas, such carbon monoxide or hydrogen, existing in the downstream. The membrane remains hydrogen permeable after the downstream sweep gas is changed from the reducing gas to the inert gas. This phenomenon is explained by the electronic conductivity of the materials. These results further confirm that SrCe1-xTbxO3-?? (0.025 {\textless} x {\textless} 0.1) is a mixed proton-electron conducting material in a hydrogen containing atmosphere. The activation energy of hydrogen permeation is close to the activation energy of electronic conduction of the materials, confirming that the hydrogen permeation is determined by the electronic conductivity of the material. For SrCe0.95Tb0.05O3-??, increasing the downstream CO partial pressure from 0.001 to 0.1 atm leads to a small increase in hydrogen flux from 1.4 ?? 10-2 to 1.6 ?? 10-2 ml/cm2 min.

In this report, we investigate and compare CO adsorption behavior on Pt (1. 1. 1) and Pd (1. 1. 1) surfaces combining first-principles (FP) calculations and lattice gas Monte-Carlo (LG-MC) simulations. Our results indicate that despite stronger CO binding on Pd (1. 1. 1) at low coverage, more repulsive lateral interactions on Pd surface lead to a more rapid adsorption energy decrease with respect to coverage. This results in lower saturation coverage and weaker CO desorption energies on Pd (1. 1. 1), which could contribute to its excellent reactivity observed under high pressure reaction conditions. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

An apparent size of the solute atom is incorporated in the analysis to approximately account for the electronic interactions between the outermost quantum shells of the solute and solvent atoms. The comparison with experimental data for various alloy systems and deviations from Vegard's law are analyzed. The free energy of binary alloys and the ordering of solute atoms at higher solute concentrations are then discussed. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reseved.},

abstract = {Zinc oxide (ZnO) and zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF?8) core?shell heterostructures were obtained by using the self-template strategy where ZnO nanorods not only act as the template, but also provide Zn2+ ions for the formation of ZIF?8 shell. The ZIF?8 shell was uniformly deposited to form ZnO@ZIF?8 nanorods with core?shell heterostructures at 70 °C for 24 h as the optimum reaction time by the hydrothermal synthesis. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images revealed that the ZnO@ZIF?8 heterostructures are composed of ZnO as core and ZIF?8 as shell. Nitrogen (N2) sorption isotherms demonstrated that the as-prepared ZnO@ZIF?8 nanorods are a typical microporous material. Additionally, the ZnO@ZIF?8 nanorods sensor exhibited distinct gas response for reducing gases with different molecule sizes. The selectivity of the ZnO@ZIF?8 nanorods sensor was obviously improved for the detection of formaldehyde owing to the limitation effect of the aperture of ZIF?8 shell. This study demonstrated that semiconductor@MOF core?shell heterostructures may be a novel way to enhance the selectivity of the gas sensing materials.},

abstract = {We demonstrate the synthesis of CuBTC and ZIF-8 on a polysulfone based porous asymmetric ultrafiltration (UF) membrane by in situ growth followed by the LBL deposition of crystals without any need for pre-seeding or surface modification of the membrane. In this way, the top surface of the UF membrane pores is completely covered by MOFs; while the remaining part of the membrane offers a flexible support to the MOFs. The pore apertures of the MOF nanoparticles located at the pore opening of the UF membrane act as channels for the entry of penetrants. The remaining porous sublayer of the membrane carries penetrants on the permeate side without significant resistance. These composite membranes were characterized by PXRD and SEM. The gas permeation study was performed using pure gases of industrial significance (H2, C3H6 and CO2). The performance of CuBTC@PSF showed enhanced selectivity, of 7.2 and 5.7 for H2/CO2 and H2/C3H6 respectively, to that of the pristine PSF membrane.},

abstract = {Pd-Cu alloy membrane was prepared by electroless plating on porous stainless steel (PSS) support. Sol-gel derived ceria was introduced as the intermediate layer by a sol-dip-coating method to prevent intermetallic diffusion and to enhance the affinity between the support and membrane. Ceria layer moderates the pore size and porosity of the support effectively to meet the needs of the alloy layer deposition. Permeation test was carried out in a high temperature range, i.e. 573-773 K with a pressure difference of 0.1 MPa. The results showed that properly prepared ceria layer was effective as the diffusion barrier in the temperature range examined, which is suitable for water-gas shift reaction. The performance of the membranes in this work is also compared with that in our previous work in which pure Pd membrane and yttrium stabilized zirconia intermediate layer were examined. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The tungstates Ln 6WO 12 present sufficient protonic and electronic mixed conductivity and stability in moist CO 2 environments and are potential candidates for the separation of hydrogen at high temperatures. Hydrogen separation properties of (La 5/6Nd 1/6) 5.5WO 12-$\delta$ were systematically analyzed, specifically, the influence of the H 2 concentration in feed stream, humidification degree and operating temperature on the hydrogen separation were studied. The best permeation results were achieved when both membrane sides were humidified (2.5 vol.{\%} H 2O), i.e., the highest hydrogen flux was 0.046 mL min -1cm - 2 at 1000 °C for membrane thickness of 0.9 mm. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Graphene oxide (GO) materials have potential applications in the field of membrane separation. Here we describe a strategy for the construction of ultra-thin and flexible HKUST-1@GO intercalated membranes, where HKUST-1 is a copper-based metal–organic framework with coordinatively unsaturated metal sites, with simultaneous and synergistic modulation of permeance and selectivity to achieve high H2/CO2 separation. CuO nanosheets@GO membranes are fabricated layer-by-layer via repeated filtration cycles, then transformed to HKUST-1@GO membranes upon in situ reaction with linkers. The HKUST-1@GO membranes show enhanced performance for gas separation of H2/CO2 mixture. The number of filtration cycles is optimized to obtain H2 permeance of 5.77 × 10−7 mol m−2 s−1 Pa−1 and H2/CO2 selectivity of 73.2. Our work provides a facile strategy for the construction of membranes based on metal–organic frameworks and GO, which may be applied in the preparation of flexible membranes for gas separation applications.},

The combination of fast sol-gel methods and RTP techniques reduced the overall membrane fabrication time from a minimum of 7 days to approximately 12h. The successful RTP technique was developed by changing the silica precursor from tetraethyl orthosilicate to ethyl silicate 40 and adjusting the nitric acid and water ratios in the sol-gel process. The optimized sol-gel conditions for the best membranes were found to deliver average He permeances of 3×10-7molm-2s-1Pa-1and He/N2permselectivities of 69 at 450°C.

The remarkable high-temperature ligand-based fluorescence, demonstrated here with tetraphenylethylene- and dihydroxyterephthalate-based linkers, is essential for enabling selective and rapid detection of analytes in the gas phase. Both Zn2(TCPE) (TCPE = tetrakis(4-carboxyphenyl)ethylene) and Mg(H2DHBDC) (H2DHBDC(2-) = 2,5-dihydroxybenzene-1,4-dicarboxylate) function as selective sensors for ammonia at 100 °C, although neither shows NH3 selectivity at room temperature. Variable-temperature diffuse-reflectance infrared spectroscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy, and X-ray crystallography are coupled with density-functional calculations to interrogate the temperature-dependent guest-framework interactions and the preferential analyte binding in each material. These results describe a heretofore unrecognized, yet potentially general property of many rigid, fluorescent MOFs and portend new applications for these materials in selective sensors, with selectivity profiles that can be tuned as a function of temperature.},

abstract = {Hydrogen is being pursued as a sustainable energy carrier for fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) and as a means of storing renewable energy at utility scale. Hydrogen can also be used as a fuel in stationary fuel cell systems for buildings, backup power, or distributed generation. Blending hydrogen into the existing natural gas pipeline network has been proposed as a means of increasing the output of renewable energy systems such as large wind farms. If implemented with relatively low concentrations, less than 5{\%}–15{\%} hydrogen by volume, this strategy of storing and delivering renewable energy to markets appears to be viable without significantly increasing risks associated with utilization of the gas blend in end-use devices (such as household appliances), overall public safety, or the durability and integrity of the existing natural gas pipeline network. However, the appropriate blend concentration may vary significantly between pipeline network systems and natural gas compositions and must therefore be assessed on a case-by-case basis. Any introduction of a hydrogen blend concentration would require extensive study, testing, and modifications to existing pipeline monitoring and maintenance practices (e.g., integrity management systems). Additional cost would be incurred as a result, and this cost must be weighed against the benefit of providing a more sustainable and low-carbon gas product to consumers.},

The uniform fine NiO–BZCY composite powders as the precursor of top membranes were co-synthesized through the citrate–nitrate combustion route (co-synthesis method), which was the key to fabricating Ni–BZCY thin membrane. The homogeneity and phase structure of two phases in powders were characterized using element-map technique and X-ray diffraction analysis, respectively. The fluxes through a metal–ceramic membrane of about 30-$\mu$m-thickness were measured as a function of temperature under different feed gas hydrogen partial pressures. The results indicated the asymmetric membrane displayed high hydrogen permeation flux and using 80{\%}H2/N2 (with 3{\%} of H2O) as feed gas and dry high purity argon as sweep gas, a maximum flux of 2.4×10−7molcm−2s−1 was achieved at 900°C, exhibiting the predominance of asymmetric structures.},

abstract = {In this study, poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) was modified by a mixture of KOH and KMNO4 in order to effect HF elimination. During this reaction, some functional groups were created in the PVDF structure. The metal–organic frameworks, MIL-53(Al) and NH2-MIL-35(Al), were embedded in modified PVDF (M-PVDF) to fabricate mixed matrix membranes (MMMs). Different characterization techniques such as FT-IR, XRD, SEM, DSC, TGA, and contact angle tests have been implemented to identify the prepared membranes. Pure and mixed (1:1) CO2 and CH4 were used to test gas separation performance of MMMs. CO2 permeance was increased for pure M-PVDF membrane compared with the pristine PVDF by 31.2{\%}. Upon 10 wt {\%} loading of MIL-53(Al) and NH2-MIL-35(Al) in M-PVDF, CO2 permeability increased 104.33{\%} and 80.02{\%} relative to the unfilled M-PVDF. The highest CO2/CH4 ideal selectivity and separation factor of 43.9 and 42.65, respectively, were reported for NH2-MIL-35(Al)/M-PVDF with 10 wt {\%} loading. These improvements could be attr...},

abstract = {A series of copolymer, poly(phthalazinone ether sulfone ketone)s (PPESKs) with the sulfone over ketone unit (S/K) ratio varying from 20/80, 50/50 to 80/20, were used as precursors to prepare carbon membranes. The effects of chemical structure as S/K ratio of PPESKs on the microstructure and gas separation performance of their derived carbon membranes were mainly investigated. The properties of PPESKs were detected in terms of density, fractional free volume, char yield, interlayer distance and glass transition temperature. During the formation process of carbon membranes (i.e., stabilization and pyrolysis), the changes in functional groups, microstructural parameters and gas permeation were monitored by FTIR, X-ray diffraction, TEM and single gas permeation techniques. The results have shown that the microstructure and gas permeation of obtained carbon membranes are significantly affected by the S/K ratio in precursor PPESKs. Carbon membranes exhibit higher selectivity and lower permeability when prepared at low pyrolytic temperature (i.e., 650 °C and 800 °C) and from PPESKs with S/K ratio equaling 50/50, followed with 20/80 and 80/20. As for carbon membranes prepared at high pyrolytic temperature (i.e., 950 °C), the selectivity order of them is well in accordance with S/K mole ratio in precursor PPESKs: 20/80 {\textgreater} 50/50 {\textgreater} 80/20, and vice versa for permeability. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

X-ray diffraction (XRD) was used to characterize the phase structure of both the powder and sintered membrane. The microstructure of the sintered membranes was studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Hydrogen permeation through the SrCe0.75Zr0.20Tm0.05O3-?? membranes was carried out using gas permeation setup at 900 ??C. Hydrogen permeation flux of SrCe0.75Zr0.20Tm0.05O3-?? membrane reaches up to 0.042 mL/min cm2 at H2 partial pressure of 0.4 atm.

abstract = {The effects of heat treatment in air on H 2 sorption over the free-standing 25-??m cold-worked Pd-Ag25wt{\%} and Pd-Au10wt{\%} membrane surfaces were investigated. The equilibrium sorption results demonstrated that H 2 solubility did not change for both Pd-Ag and Pd-Au membranes before and after air oxidation at 300??C. The sorption kinetics data revealed a much faster H 2 sorption rates for the as-received Pd-Au membrane than the as-received Pd-Ag alloy. The heat treatment in air accelerated the H 2 sorption kinetics for both membranes at small H 2 equilibrium pressure (EP) of 0.16kPa. However, the oxidation enhancement extent is greater for Pd-Ag and the disparity becomes more significant when EP increases. The sorption rate enhancement for Pd-Ag membrane existed over a wide range of EPs even though the enhancement effect decreased with increasing EPs. For Pd-Au membrane, the enhancement induced by air oxidation decreased sharply when EP increased because the sorption rate is already very fast for the as-received Pd-Au alloy and there is less latitude for further improvement than Pd-Ag membrane. It is found that the variation of H 2 sorption rates over membrane surfaces correlates to the change of H 2 permeability. After heat treatment in air, the Pd-Ag membrane experienced a systematic increase in H 2 permeability with higher permeability increase at lower pressures while there was basically no permeation increase due to air oxidation effect for the Pd-Au membrane within the pressure range of practical H 2 permeation tests, which are consistent with the previously reported sorption rates hypothesis and results. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

Unlike previous works with conventional sensors, a hydrothermal synthesis was not used to prepare a zeolite film. Instead, a zeolite coating was formed on top of the Pd/SnO2 surface by microdropping from a zeolite suspension. In spite of this, the response of the sensor with zeolite is significantly different from that of unmodified sensors, and essentially reproduces the performance of zeolite-coated conventional sensors. By avoiding the use of a hydrothermal synthesis the integrity of the sensor is better preserved, and the resulting non-continuous zeolite film has the added advantage of a strong reduction in response times. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {This work is the first demonstration of rapid thermal processing techniques as applied to metal oxide/silica membranes on tubular geometries. A procedure was developed which combined fast sol-gel synthesis, rapid calcination steps and a thermal annealing stage to reduce the membrane fabrication time by more than two-thirds, from a conventional process taking seven or more days to less than two. A significant aspect of this major development was the use of a pre-hydrolysed silica precursor ethyl silicate 40 (ES40), instead of the generally preferred tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) which eliminated the need for the researcher specific and time consuming sol-gel reaction stages prior to membrane fabrication. As a result, modified-silica membranes containing cobalt oxides could be directly calcined at 600 C, instead of conventional thermal process which require slow ramping rates of ≤1 C min-1 to avoid cracking. As-prepared membranes delivered H2 permeances of 5 × 10-7 mol m-2 s-1 Pa-1 at 450 C and H2/N2 permselectivities of 54. The RTP techniques demonstrated in this work greatly reduced the production time and should both allow researchers to significantly increase their productivity and ultimately reduce the barriers for deployment of inorganic membranes into industrial applications. {\textcopyright} 2013, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

The thermodynamic driving force of the reaction is the formation of the chemical sulfur-sulfur bond between two hydrogen sulfide molecules adsorbed on two adjacent metal atoms in the key surface intermediate and elimination of hydrogen into gas phase. "Fingerprints" of diatomic sulfur adsorbed on the solid surfaces and dissolved in different solvents are studied. In closed vessels in adsorbed or dissolved states, this molecule is stable for a long period of time (weeks). A possible electronic structure of diatomic gaseous sulfur in the singlet state is considered. According to DFT/CASSCF calculations, energy of the singlet state of S-2 molecule is over the triplet ground state energy for 10.4/14.4 kcal/mol. Some properties of gaseous diatomic sulfur are also investigated. Catalytic solid systems, both bulk and supported on porous carriers, are developed. When hydrogen sulfide is passing through the solid catalyst immersed in liquid solvent which is capable of dissolving sulfur generated, conversion of hydrogen sulfide at room temperature achieves 100 {\%}, producing hydrogen in gas phase. This gives grounds to consider hydrogen sulfide as inexhaustible potential source of hydrogen-a very valuable chemical reagent and environmentally friendly energy product.},

abstract = {Stable Cu(2)O nanocrystals of around 3 nm were uniformly and densely grown on functionalized graphene sheets (FGS), which act as molecular templates instead of surfactants for controlled nucleation; the distribution density of nanocrystals can be easily controlled by FGS with different C/O ratios. The nanocomposite displays improved stability of the crystalline phase in wet air, which is attributed to finite-size effects that the high-symmetry crystalline phase is to be more stable at smaller size. Meanwhile, we conjecture that the oxygen adsorbed on the interfacial surface prefers to extract electrons from FGS, thus the interfacial bonding also makes a contribution in alleviating the process of corrosion to some extent. More importantly, the Cu(2)O-FGS nanocomposite based sensor realizes room temperature sensing to H(2)S with fantastic sensitivity (11{\%}); even at the exposed concentration of 5 ppb, the relative resistance changes show good linearity with the logarithm of the concentration. The enhancement of sensitivity is attributed to the synergistic effect of Cu(2)O and FGS; on the one hand, surfactant-free capped Cu(2)O nanocrystals display higher surface activity to adsorb gas molecules, and on the other hand, FGS acting as conducting network presents greater electron transfer efficiency. These observations show that the Cu(2)O-FGS nanocomposite based sensors have potential applications for monitoring air pollution at room temperature with low cost and power consumption.},

abstract = {Metal-organic framework (MOF), a nanoporous compound, has been used as sensing material to fabricate capacitive nanosensor. The proposed nanosensor was fabricated by growing a Cu-BTC (MOF-199) film on a copper substrate using electrochemical method. 1-Methyl,3-octylimidazolium chloride, an ionic liquid (IL), was used as conducting salt in the electrochemical cell. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), FTIR spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction analysis, and BET techniques were used to characterize the prepared MOF which shows a thin film (about 5 $\mu$m) of Cu-BTC layer with particle size of 2-3 $\mu$m. In order to fabricate the upper electrode of capacitor some interconnected Ag paste dots were patterned on the MOF layer which was coated on the copper surface as back electrode. This fabricated sensor was used for investigation of the capacitance variations in the presence of different amounts of introduced ethanol and methanol vapors. The capacitive sensing parameters were measured by a LCR meter. Relative capacitance variations were measured to verify the potential of the Cu-BTC films for using as dielectric layer in this capacitive sensor. The linear range of the signal vs. concentration is 0-1000 ppm for ethanol and methanol. Limit of detection of the fabricated sensors were 130.0 ppm and 39.1 ppm for ethanol and methanol, respectively. The selectivity of the sensor for polar and nonpolar VOCs were examined by introducing n-hexane in sensing chamber.},

Despite good separation properties in liquid applications, the selectivity for gas separations has yet been too low. Here, we report membranes from 1,2-bis(triethoxysilyl)ethane (BTESE) with H{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}/N{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} permselectivity between 50 and over 400. The membranes are fabricated from a dip-sol with a H{\textless}sup{\textgreater}+{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}:Si ratio of 0.01 that is applied onto a support system with a controlled low water content (pre-treated at RH{\textless}0.5{\%}). For support systems pre-treated at 90{\%} RH, H{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}/N{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} permselectivities≤10 are obtained, indicating larger pores. The pore formation process is studied in situ by Small-Angle X-ray Scattering in a dedicated setup. The formation of larger pores can be understood by a higher condensation rate and longer drying times when more water is present. This results in a stronger network that better withstands the compressive forces during drying. By limiting both the water and acid contents in the dipped sol, a dense pore structure is obtained that gives the highest H{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}/N{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} and CO{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}/CH{\textless}inf{\textgreater}4{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} permselectivities found to date for hybrid silica membranes. Further variation of the water and acid concentration will allow for additional tuning of the separation properties for both gas and liquid separation.},

Hydrogen permeance for the membrane used in the study was found to be in the range of 3x10-8 to 1x10-7mol/m2sPa and H2/He selectivities were in the range of 4-4000, depending mainly on Ag concentration and microstructure of the Pd-Ag films. A simple model based on the material balance concept has been developed to describe the transient composition behavior of the multicomponent sputter deposition process. The model is compared with experimental data over a range of deposition powers and target equilibration times. The results of the model agree well with experimental data. Both theoretical and experimental data show that deposition power and target equilibration are the most important variables affecting membrane composition. Copyright (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.},

The results indicate that two types of membrane morphologies, i.e. finger-like and sponge-like structures can be expected. It is believed that finger-like void formation in asymmetric ceramic membranes is initiated by hydrodynamically unstable viscous fingering developed when a less viscous fluid (non-solvent) is in contact with a higher viscosity fluid (ceramic suspension containing invertible polymer binder). Finger-like void growth occurs only below a critical suspension viscosity, above which a sponge-like structure is observed over the entire hollow fibre cross-section. The effects of the air-gap, viscosity and non-solvent concentration on fibre morphology have been studied and it has been determined that viscosity is the dominating factor for ceramic systems.},

Gas permeation of the membranes was examined at the temperature ranges at 100-300 °C. The hydrogen flux for the membranes of low Ag content gave a marked change giving a peak in the range of 170-200 °C, which was attributed to the $\alpha$-$\beta$ crystal phase transition of the hydride. The peak in hydrogen flux became less significant and appears as shoulder along with the increase of silver content. This observation coincides with the decrease of lattice size difference between $\alpha$ and $\beta$ phase by the increase of Ag content in the Pd-Ag alloy. Improved durability of the alloy membrane (Ag {\textgreater} 20{\%}) was demonstrated by cyclic change of gas and temperature and was attributed to the suppression of lattice expansion by alloying with more than 20{\%} of silver. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

The addition of copper or silver to the palladium film improved the membrane, making it suitable to be utilized below 573 K, at the same time maintaining the extremely high selectivity.

The H2 permeation in the membranes was found to follow Sievert's law between 325-500??C. The steady state H2 flux was stable for over 200 h. The hydrogen permeance was measured at 350??C with a 1-atm pressure difference and ranged from 20.0 to 5.1 m3/(m2??h??atm0.5) for a Pd layer thickness of 11.7 and 33.8 ??m, respectively. The thickness of the membranes and therefore the permeance obtained was dependent on the size of the largest pores present in the support. The thickness of the Pd layer was approximately three times the dimension of the largest pores in the support, consistent with the previous theoretical results of Ma et al. [3].},

abstract = {The Queen Scallop Aequipecten opercularis has been an important part of the marine fauna of the northeast Atlantic region since the Miocene, and is a suitable candidate for palaeoenvironmental studies using stable isotopes. Modern shells were investigated to determine if carbonate is precipitated in isotopic equilibrium in this species, and to confirm that growth continues through the year. Specimens of A. opercularis were cultured under monitored semi-natural conditions over an autumn/winter period, and the analyses of these specimens were supplemented with isotope data from preserved indigenous North Sea specimens. The results indicated that the cultured specimens grew in relatively low temperatures, that oxygen isotopes of shell-exterior carbonate were precipitated in isotopic equilibrium, and that a large proportion of the ambient temperature range was recorded in shell carbonate. The indigenous North Sea specimens exhibited a good correspondence to predicted oxygen isotope values for summer; the isotopic record related to winter was, however, somewhat truncated due to growth decelerations in the specimens. Carbon isotopes of shell-exterior carbonate were calculated as being derived primarily from external sources, and showed comparatively little influence from metabolically derived carbon; this suggests that carbon isotopes were at least close to equilibrium with ambient waters. The limited incorporation of metabolic products suggests that A. opercularis would be a good monitor of changing carbon isotope ratios in seawater-dissolved inorganic carbon. The occurrence of equilibrium shell precipitation is explained using a 'pteriomorph shell-calcification model', which proposes that transport of ions through the periostracum caused the composition of the extrapallial fluid to be effectively the same as seawater. Carbonate secretion is, therefore, not influenced significantly by biological (vital) effects.},

High surface area, interwire junctions, and restricted conduction pathways give intrinsically high sensitivity and new mechanisms to transduce the binding or action of analytes. This Review details the status of NW chemosensors with selected examples from the literature. We begin by proposing a principle for understanding electrical transport and transduction mechanisms in NW sensors. Next, we offer the reader a review of device performance parameters. Then, we consider the different NW types followed by a summary of NW assembly and different device platform architectures. Subsequently, we discuss NW functionalization strategies. Finally, we propose future developments in NW sensing to address selectivity, sensor drift, sensitivity, response analysis, and emerging applications.},

In particular, the detection of industrial toxic gases such as CO, NO{\textless}inf{\textgreater}x{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}, and NH{\textless}inf{\textgreater}3{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} is very important for many industries. Metal oxides have been widely studied for the sensitivity of their properties to gases even though they do have some limitations. Recently, graphene has been considered as a promising material for gas sensing since its electronic properties are strongly affected by the adsorption of foreign molecules. Intrinsic graphene has high sensitivity at low gas concentrations; but the sensor selectivity is poor which limits its use in many practical applications. Hence, hybrid architectures formed by blending of nanoparticles of metal-oxides with graphene or its derivatives have been explored by several researchers which showed improved gas sensing ability, especially the sensitivity and selectivity at room temperature. Here we review the state of the art of gas sensors based on graphene and metal oxide hybrid nanostructures for detection of various common toxic gases.},

Zeolite Y, 13X, and synthesized AlMCM41, all having the common cation Cu2+, were dry mixed with synthesized maleic acid (MA) doped polyaniline and compressed to form polyaniline (PANI)/zeolite pellet composites. The Y, 13X and AlMCM41 zeolite have the nominal pore sizes of 7, 10, 36 ??, and the Cu2+ exchange capacities of 0.161, 0.087, and 0.044 mol/g, respectively. With an addition of 13X zeolite to pristine polyaniline, the electrical conductivity sensitivity to CO/N2 gas increases with zeolite content. For the effect of zeolite type, the highest electrical conductivity sensitivity is obtained with the 13X zeolite, followed by the Y zeolite, and the AlMCM41 zeolite, respectively. Poor sensitivity of zeolite AlMCM41 is probably due to its very large pore size and its lowest Cu2+ exchange capacity. Y zeolite and 13X zeolite have comparable pore sizes but the latter has a greater pore free volume and a more favorable location distribution of the Cu2+ ions within the pore. The temporal response time increases with the amount of zeolite in the composites but it is inversely related to the amount of ion exchange capacity. ?? 2004 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

In addition, catalytic surface modification of the BSCF hollow fibres further increased oxygen fluxes to 14.5mlmin-1cm-2.

abstract = {? Abstract?About two-thirds of primary energy today is used directly as transportation and heating fuels. Any discussion of energy-related issues, such as air pollution, global climate change, and energy supply security, raises the issue of future use of alternative fuels. Hydrogen offers large potential benefits in terms of reduced emissions of pollutants and greenhouse gases and diversified primary energy supply. Like electricity, hydrogen is a premium-quality energy carrier, which can be used with high efficiency and zero emissions. Hydrogen can be made from a variety of feedstocks, including natural gas, coal, biomass, wastes, solar sources, wind, or nuclear sources. Hydrogen vehicles, heating, and power systems have been technically demonstrated. Key hydrogen end-use technologies such as fuel cells are making rapid progress toward commercialization. If hydrogen were made from renewable or decarbonized fossil sources, it would be possible to have a large-scale energy system with essentially no emissions of pollutants or greenhouse gases. Despite these potential benefits, the development of a large-scale hydrogen energy infrastructure is often seen as an insurmountable technical and economic barrier. Here we review the current status of technologies for hydrogen production, storage, transmission, and distribution; describe likely areas for technological progress; and discuss the implications for developing hydrogen as an energy carrier.},

abstract = {Adsorptive separation is very important in industry. Generally, the process uses porous solid materials such as zeolites, activated carbons, or silica gels as adsorbents. With an ever increasing need for a more efficient, energy-saving, and environmentally benign procedure for gas separation, adsorbents with tailored structures and tunable surface properties must be found. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), constructed by metal-containing nodes connected by organic bridges, are such a new type of porous materials. They are promising candidates as adsorbents for gas separations due to their large surface areas, adjustable pore sizes and controllable properties, as well as acceptable thermal stability. This critical review starts with a brief introduction to gas separation and purification based on selective adsorption, followed by a review of gas selective adsorption in rigid and flexible MOFs. Based on possible mechanisms, selective adsorptions observed in MOFs are classified, and primary relationships between adsorption properties and framework features are analyzed. As a specific example of tailor-made MOFs, mesh-adjustable molecular sieves are emphasized and the underlying working mechanism elucidated. In addition to the experimental aspect, theoretical investigations from adsorption equilibrium to diffusion dynamics via molecular simulations are also briefly reviewed. Furthermore, gas separations in MOFs, including the molecular sieving effect, kinetic separation, the quantum sieving effect for H2/D2 separation, and MOF-based membranes are also summarized (227 references).},

abstract = {This work investigates the redox cycling effect on the physicochemical characteristics and gas permeation behaviour of binary metal oxide (iron/cobalt) silica membranes prepared by sol–gel method from tetraethyl orthosilicate, cobalt and iron nitrates, peroxide and water. A Fe/Co ratio of 10/90 conferred more stable silica microstructure under redox cycling, contrary to Fe/Co ratios ⩾25/75 which led to structural densification after the first redox cycle. The gas permeance redox effect of Fe/Co = 10/90 silica membranes resulted in a switchable permeance increase and decrease as the membrane was reduced and oxidised, respectively. However, the extent of the switchable changes were not constant and tended to decrease at each cycle, as evidenced by the He/CO2permselectivity shift from a higher value of 130 (first oxidation cycle) down to 80 (third oxidation cycle). It was found that a shift in temperature corresponding to the exothermic oxidation peak, attributed to the progressive changes in the formation of FexCo1−xOymixed oxide embedded in the silica matrix at each redox cycle. This was further supported by the sequential disappearance of the infrared absorbance peak at 565 cm−1upon redox cycling, thus demonstrating structural re-arrangement of the membrane. The permselectivity of He and H2over CO2sequentially decreased at a higher ratio for after the oxidation cycle, as a result of the silica matrix densification at high temperatures (400 °C).},

The observed inverse linear dependence of flux with membrane thickness indicates bulk diffusion is the rate-limiting factor for hydrogen permeation.

It was found that cobalt and iron oxides were generally dispersed homogeneously in the silica structure, with the exception of a few minor patches rich in cobalt oxide. The sol-gel synthesis affected the micro-structural formation of binary metal oxide silica matrices. Increasing the iron content favoured condensation reactions and the formation of siloxane bridges, and consequently larger average pore sizes which lead to low He/N2permselectivity values below 20. In the case of high cobalt content, a higher silanol to siloxane ratio was observed with tighter pore size tailoring, as evidenced by higher He/N2permselectivities reaching 170. The binary metal oxide and silica interfaces proved to follow a molecular sieving mechanism characterised by activated transport where the permeance of the smaller gas molecules (He and H2) increased with temperature up to 500°C, whilst the permeance of larger gas molecules (CO2and N2) decreased.},

Viscosity of the phenolic polymer solution was varied from 10 to 30 centipoises (cP) to maximize performance of the CMS membranes. Pyrolysis temperature was also varied from 700 °C to 900 °C to optimize the fabrication of uniform CMS membranes on porous composite stainless steel supports. High performance CMS membranes were obtained from triple coatings and subsequent pyrolysis at 700 °C. The viscosity of precursor solutions played a critical role to determine the performance of CMS membranes in terms of gas permeance and ideal gas separation factor. The highest separation performance of the CMS membranes was shown with viscosity of 20 cP, resulting in gas separation factor of 462 for He/N2, 97 for CO2/N2, and 15.4 for O2/N2.},

abstract = {Industrial gases such as nitrogen, oxygen, argon, and helium are easily contaminated with water during production, transfer and use, because there is a high volume fraction of water in the atmosphere (approximately 1.2{\%} estimated with the average annual atmospheric temperature and relative humidity). Even trace water ({\textless}1 parts per million by volume (ppmv) of H{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}O, dew point {\textless} -76 ??C) in the industrial gases can cause quality problems in the process such as production of semiconductors. Therefore, it is important to monitor and to control trace water levels in industrial gases at each supplying step, and especially during their use. In the present study, a fiber optic gas sensor was investigated for monitoring trace water levels in industrial gases. The sensor consists of a film containing a metal organic framework (MOF). MOFs are made of metals coordinated to organic ligands, and have mesoscale pores that adsorb gas molecules. When the MOF, copper benzene-1,3,5-tricarboxylate (Cu-BTC), was used as a sensing material, we investigated the color of Cu-BTC with water adsorption changed both in depth and tone. Cu-BTC crystals appeared deep blue in dry gases, and then changed to light blue in wet gases. An optical gas sensor with the Cu-BTC film was developed using a light emitting diode as the light source and a photodiode as the light intensity detector. The sensor showed a reversible response to trace water, did not require heating to remove the adsorbed water molecules. The sample gas flow rate did not affect the sensitivity. The obtained limit of detection was 40 parts per billion by volume (ppbv). The response time for sample gas containing 2.5 ppmvH{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}O was 23 s. The standard deviation obtained for daily analysis of 1.0 ppmvH{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}O standard gas over 20 days was 9{\%}. Furthermore, the type of industrial gas did not affect the sensitivity. These properties mean the sensor will be applicable to trace water detection in various industrial gases.},

abstract = {A novel synthesis strategy was developed for the seeding-free preparation of dense LTA zeolite membranes by using 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane as covalent linker between zeolite membrane and porous Al2O3 support. In a first step, the ethoxy groups of the 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane react with surface hydroxy groups of the support. In a second step, the 3-aminopropylsilyl groups react with silanols of the zeolite crystals, leading to a "bridge" between the growing LTA zeolite membrane and the support being built to anchor the LTA zeolite layer onto the support. The SEM image and XRD indicate that a dense and pure LTA zeolite membrane with a thickness of about 3.5 $\mu$m can be formed on the $\alpha$-Al2O3 support, and no cracks, pinholes or other defects are visible. The LTA zeolite membrane displays good molecular sieving performance. For binary mixtures at 20 °C, the separation factors of H2/CH4, H2/N2, H2/O2 and H2/CO2 are 3.6, 4.2, 4.4 and 5.5, respectively, which are higher than the corresponding value of Knudsen diffusion.

abstract = {The empirical upper bound relationship for membrane separation of gases initially published in 1991 has been reviewed with the myriad of data now presently available. The upper bound correlation follows the relationship Pi= k $\alpha$i jn, where Piis the permeability of the fast gas, $\alpha$ij(Pi/Pj) is the separation factor, k is referred to as the "front factor" and n is the slope of the log-log plot of the noted relationship. Below this line on a plot of log $\alpha$ijversus log Pi, virtually all the experimental data points exist. In spite of the intense investigation resulting in a much larger dataset than the original correlation, the upper bound position has had only minor shifts in position for many gas pairs. Where more significant shifts are observed, they are almost exclusively due to data now in the literature on a series of perfluorinated polymers and involve many of the gas pairs comprising He. The shift observed is primarily due to a change in the front factor, k, whereas the slope of the resultant upper bound relationship remains similar to the prior data correlations. This indicates a different solubility selectivity relationship for perfluorinated polymers compared to hydrocarbon/aromatic polymers as has been noted in the literature. Two additional upper bound relationships are included in this analysis; CO2/N2and N2/CH4. In addition to the perfluorinated polymers resulting in significant upper bound shifts, minor shifts were observed primarily due to polymers exhibiting rigid, glassy structures including ladder-type polymers. The upper bound correlation can be used to qualitatively determine where the permeability process changes from solution-diffusion to Knudsen diffusion. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Early developments (1970-1980) using syngas from coal gasification plants primarily focused on fixed-bed and fluidized-bed methanation technologies. Temperature control and catalyst deactivation, e.g. caused by fouling and mechanical stress, were key issues of investigation. Due to the debate about a sustainable energy supply, research on methanation has been intensified during the last ten years. Novel reactor developments comprise e.g. micro reactors and three-phase reactors aiming at an advanced temperature control and a reduced complexity of future methanation plants. The developments are supported by detailed modeling and simulation work to optimize the design and dynamic behavior. To accompany and facilitate new methanation developments, the present work is aimed at giving researchers a comprehensive overview of methanation research conducted during the last century. On one hand, application-orientated research focusing on reactor developments, reactor modeling, and pilot plant investigation is reviewed.

abstract = {The addition of gold to palladium membranes produces many desirable effects for hydrogen purification, including improved tolerance of sulfur compounds, reduction in hydride phase formation, and, for certain compositions, improved hydrogen permeability. The focus of this work is to determine if sequential plating can be used to produce self-supported alloy membranes with equivalent properties to membranes produced by conventional metallurgical techniques such as cold-working. Sequential electroplating and electroless plating were used to produce freestanding planar Pd-Au membranes with Au contents ranging from 0 to 20 wt{\%}, consisting of Au layers on both sides of a pure Pd core. Membranes were characterized by single-gas permeation measurements, scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM/EDS), and high temperature, controlled-atmosphere XRD (HTXRD). Sequentially plated foils tested without any prior annealing had significantly lower H2 permeabilities than either measured or literature values for homogeneous foils of equivalent composition. This effect appears to be due to the formation of stable gold-enriched surface layers. Pretreatment of membranes to 1023 K created membranes with hydrogen permeabilities equivalent to literature values, despite the fact that trace amounts of surface gold remained detectable with XRD. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {We prepared a heterostructure hybrid of PANI and SnO2 by a rapid and facile in situ chemical oxidation polymerization under very low monomer concentration, and the hybrid was loaded on a flexible PET thin film to structure a smart NH3 sensor. The structure, morphology and thermal stability of the hybrid were characterized by various analysis methods. Compared with those reported in literatures, the hybrid-based sensor not only has high sensitivity, good selectivity and wide linear response to NH3 at room temperature of 21 ??C but also has flexible, structure simple and wearable performance. The room temperature operating of the sensor is particularly interesting, which leads to low-power consumption, environmental safety and long life times of the sensing materials. The improvement of sensing properties is attributed to the complementary and synergistic effect between SnO2 and PANI, and formation of p-n heterojunction at the interface in hybrid.},

Sulfur resistance, as evidenced by no significant change in permeance, was correlated with the temperatures associated with the face-centered-cubic crystalline structure for the alloys in this study. The permeance of the body-centered cubic phase, however, was up to two orders of magnitude lower when exposed to H2S.

We demonstrate that few- and several-layered graphene and graphene oxide (GO) sheets can be engineered to exhibit the desired gas separation characteristics. Selective gas diffusion can be achieved by controlling gas flow channels and pores via different stacking methods. For layered (3- to 10-nanometer) GO membranes, tunable gas transport behavior was strongly dependent on the degree of interlocking within the GO stacking structure. High carbon dioxide/nitrogen selectivity was achieved by well-interlocked GO membranes in high relative humidity, which is most suitable for postcombustion carbon dioxide capture processes, including a humidified feed stream.},

abstract = {BaCe0.85Tb0.05Co0.10O3-?? (BCTCo) perovskite hollow fibre membranes were fabricated by a combined phase-inversion and sintering technique. The hollow fibre surfaces were modified by coating Ni or Pd particles. Hydrogen permeation fluxes at 700-1000??C can be improved due to the surface modification from the original 0.009-0.164mL(STP) cm-2 min-1 to 0.018-0.269mLcm-2 min-1 for the Ni-coated membranes with maximum improvement by 64{\%}, and to 0.1-0.42mLcm-2 min-1 for the Pd-loaded membranes with maximum enhancement by 155{\%}, respectively. Loading of the catalyst on the hollow fibre outer surface is better than on the inner surface, but coating on both sides may enhance the hydrogen permeation most effectively. The permeation enhancement depends on both the catalyst loading amount and its structure, which can be controlled by the plating conditions. The optimal Pd loading and coverage should be around 0.667mgcm-2 and 82{\%}, respectively for maximizing the permeation improvement.},

For each species, we determine the optimal binding geometry and corresponding binding energy. The vibrational frequencies of these adsorbed species are calculated and are found to be in good agreement with experimental values that have been reported in literature. From the binding energies, we calculate potential energy surfaces for the decomposition of NO, CO, N2, NH3, and CH4 on Pd(111), showing that only the decomposition of NO is thermochemically preferred to its molecular desorption."

Defect-free membranes can exhibit effectively infinite selectivity but must also provide high fluxes, resistance to poisoning, long operational lifetimes, and low cost. Alloying offers one route to improve on membranes based on pure metals such as palladium. We show how ab initio calculations and coarse-grained modeling can accurately predict hydrogen fluxes through binary alloy membranes as functions of alloy composition, temperature, and pressure. Our approach, which requires no experimental input apart from knowledge of bulk crystal structures, is demonstrated for palladium-copper alloys, which show nontrivial behavior due to the existence of face-centered cubic and body-centered cubic crystal structures and have the potential to resist sulfur poisoning. The accuracy of our approach is examined by a comparison with extensive experiments using thick foils at elevated temperatures. Our experiments also demonstrate the ability of these membranes to resist poisoning by hydrogen sulfide.},

Our DFT results indicate that the diffusion activation energy for interstitial H in ordered bcc Cu50Pd50 is over an order of magnitude smaller than that for pure Pd. We present a detailed description of the range of diffusion activation energies available for local hops of interstitial H in disordered fcc Cu48Pd52 and describe how the net activation energy for long-range H diffusion in this material can be inferred from these results.

Our results show that the variation in permeability of hydrogen among these alloys is more closely tied to variations in solubility than variations in diffusivity. These results give a detailed description of a ternary alloy of practical interest for high temperature H2 purification and also demonstrate a general strategy for making predictions about complex metal alloys for this application."

The combination of microscale resonators and nanoscale materials simultaneously permits the benefit of larger capture area for adsorption from the resonator and enhanced surface adsorption capacity from the nanoscale ZIF structure. Dielectrophoresis (DEP) was demonstrated as a novel method for directly assembling concentrated ZIF nanoparticles on targeted regions of silicon resonant sensors. As part of the dielectrophoretic assembly process, the first ever measurements of the Clausius-Mossotti factor for ZIFs were conducted to determine optimal conditions for DEP assembly. The first ever real-time adsorption measurements of ZIFs were also performed to investigate the possibility of inherent gas selectivity. The ZIF-coupled resonators demonstrated sensitivity improvement up to 150 times over a bare silicon resonator with identical dimensions, and real-time adsorption measurements of ZIFs revealed different adsorption time constants for IPA and CO2.},

An acidic catalyst layer converting C2H5OH into C2H4 with a low sensitivity by dehydration was coated on the sensing layer of the La2O3–Au/SnO2 ceramics to reduce the sensitivity to C2H5OH. Ferrierite, one of siliceous zeolites, was found to have a prominent ethanol filtering effect; such a prominent performance was related to a strong acid strength and a large acid amount. The siliceous zeolites have a hydrophobic property, a specific area of more than a few hundreds in m2 g−1 and a thermal stability. As for the ethanol filtering effects, ka/D≥105 was estimated on the basis of a simple model of chemical dynamics, k: a rate constant of dehydration, a: an effective reaction area of the catalyst layer, D: a diffusion coefficient in the filtering layer of ferrierite. As a result, a CO selective gas sensor with a sensitivity to CO over ten times higher than that to the other gases was obtained at about 300°C.},

The texture and chem. of the initial samples and those exposed to H2S were analyzed using a wide range of anal. techniques (XRD, SEM-EDX, FTIR, thermal anal.-MS, and nitrogen adsorption).  The performance of the new composites as H2S adsorbents was much better than that of the parent MOFs.  It was owing to the formation of new microporosity as a result of linkages between the sulfonic acids and amine groups of modified GO and copper centers Cu-BTC.  The presence of moisture in the pore system increased the amt. adsorbed.  Phys. adsorption and reactive adsorption play an important role in the mechanism of retention.  The removal of H2S is favored on the composites with a higher degree of surface heterogeneity, which facilitates the retention of H2S mols. mostly in the form of sulfides.  Given the differences in the chem. of the N- and S-contg. groups in the composites, distinct mechanisms of adsorption occur, which result in sulfides/sulfates of unique morphologies.

In addition, low limits of detection (LOD) of 100 ppb (Rair/Rgas = 1.7 for acetone and Rair/Rgas = 3.3 for H2S at 300 °C) were achieved. The superior sensing properties were ascribed to the electronic sensitization of graphene based materials by modulating space charged layers at the interfaces between n-type WO3 hemitubes and p-type graphene based materials, as identified by Kelvin Probe Force Microscopy (KPFM). Rapid response and superior sensitivity of the proposed sensing materials following cyclic thermal aging demonstrates good potential for real-time exhaled breath diagnosis of diseases.},

The PBE functional [J. P. Perdew et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 77, 3865 (1996)], the most common of them, provides excellent results in many cases. However, very recently other GGA functionals have been proposed and compete in accuracy with the PBE functional, in particular for the structure of solids. We have tested these GGA functionals, as well as the local-density approximation (LDA) and TPSS (meta-GGA approximation) functionals, on a large set of solids using an accurate implementation of the Kohn-Sham equations, namely, the full-potential linearized augmented plane-wave and local orbitals method. Often these recently proposed GGA functionals lead to improvement over LDA and PBE, but unfortunately none of them can be considered as good for all investigated solids.},

abstract = {This work investigates a modified sol-gel method for the preparation of interlayer-free nickel oxide silica membranes for desalination applications. The sol–gels were synthesized using TEOS, nickel nitrate hexahydrate, ethanol as solvent and water with and without peroxide (H2O2). The effect of the nickel embedded in the silica matrix as Ni/Si molar ratio was varied from 5 to 50 mol{\%} and systematically studied. The sols prepared with H2O2resulted in microporous structures and lower pore volume, contrary to the mesoporous structures derived from sols without H2O2. The modified sol-gel method proved to be robust enough for coating directly on $\alpha$-alumina substrates, as opposed to conventional methods which required substrates with interlayers. All interlayer-free nickel oxide silica membranes delivered high salt rejection ranging from 91.5 to 99.9{\%}, and reaching water flux as high as 7.3 kg m− 2 h− 1. The membranes prepared using sols with H2O2gave lower water flux and slightly higher salt rejection, attributed to lower pore volume and smaller pore size, respectively. The membranes prepared with Ni/Si molar ratio of 25{\%} achieved the highest water flux, though salt rejection slightly decreased with the increase of feed salt concentration from brackish (NaCl 0.3 wt{\%}) to sea water (NaCl 3.5 wt{\%}).},

BCY powder was prepared by the sol-gel technique using ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and citric acid as the complexing agents. Gel calcination was carried out at high temperature to form the desired crystal structure. The qualified BCY hollow fibre membranes could not be achieved even the sintering was carried out at temperatures up to 1550oC due to the poor densification behavior of the BCY material. The addition of sintering aid (1 wt{\%} Co2O3) inside BCY powder as the membrane starting material significantly improved the densification process, leading to the formation of gas-tight BCY hollow fibres. The optimum sintering temperature of BCY hollow fibre membrane was 1400 C to achieve the best mechanical strength. H2 permeation through the BCY hollow fibre membranes was carried out between 700 and 1050 C using 25{\%} H2-He mixture as feed gas and N 2 as sweep gas, respectively. For comparison purpose, the disk-shaped BCY membrane with a thickness of 1 mm was also prepared.

abstract = {In this work we investigate the effect of high temperature steam on cobalt and cobalt oxide derived silica with an aim to providing an understanding of the permeation and gas separation performance of cobalt silica membranes exposed to simulated industrial wet gas streams. Cobalt silica (CoSi) and cobalt oxide silica (CoOxSi) xerogels were synthesized and exposed to steam at 500 °C for varying time periods. Subsequent characterization with FTIR and N2adsorption revealed that CoOxSi xerogels were significantly more hydrostable than CoSi xerogels, with few structural changes observed and only moderate densification (∼43{\%}) of the CoOxSi matrix experienced even after the longest steam exposure. In comparison the CoSi matrix experienced severe densification (∼89{\%}) after only short term steam exposure. CoOxSi was therefore selected as the optimal material for further membrane tests and CoOxSi membranes were subsequently synthesized using sol-gel techniques and exposed to steam in both high temperature long term stability studies and during temperature cycling tests. Exposure to steam had an adverse effect on membrane performance with the largest effect occurring during the initial stages where He permeance dropped from 3.95 × 10-8to 2.05 × 10-10mol m-2s-1Pa-1and He/N2ideal selectivities from 123 to 45, respectively after 135 h of testing. However, following this initial period of steam conditioning, these membranes were able to oppose further deterioration and maintain acceptable steady state performance. Further tests with an increased steam rate showed that nitrogen permeation decreased more significantly than helium, leading to a rise in membrane ideal selectivity, suggesting that steam was competitively blocking the pores available to nitrogen adsorption and/or reducing the diffusion of nitrogen. Steam testing under cycling temperature conditions showed that below 400 °C, the membrane ideal selectivity was low. However, above 400 °C the membrane consistently exhibited a molecular sieving mechanism. In addition water permeation through the membrane varied with temperature suggesting that the membrane matrix continuously underwent reversible structural modification by the combined effect of water and temperature. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Hydrogen permeation membranes are a key element in improving the energy conversion efficiency and decreasing the greenhouse gas emissions from energy generation. The scientific community faces the challenge of identifying and optimizing stable and effective ceramic materials for H2 separation membranes at elevated temperature (400-800 degrees C) for industrial separations and intensified catalytic reactors. As such, composite materials with nominal composition BaCe0.8Eu0.2O3-delta:Ce0.8Y0.2O2-delta revealed unprecedented H2 permeation levels of 0.4 to 0.61 mL.min-1.cm-2 at 700 degrees C measured on 500 mum-thick-specimen. A detailed structural and phase study revealed single phase perovskite and fluorite starting materials synthesized via the conventional ceramic route. Strong tendency of Eu to migrate from the perovskite to the fluorite phase was observed at sintering temperature, leading to significant Eu depletion of the proton conducing BaCe0.8Eu0.2O3-delta phase. Composite microstructure was examined prior and after a variety of functional tests, including electrical conductivity, H2-permeation and stability in CO2 containing atmospheres at elevated temperatures, revealing stable material without morphological and structural changes, with segregation-free interfaces and no further diffusive effects between the constituting phases. In this context, dual phase material based on BaCe0.8Eu0.2O3-delta:Ce0.8Y0.2O2-delta represents a very promising candidate for H2 separating membrane in energy- and environmentally-related applications.},

abstract = {Membrane separation of CO2from synthesis gas could be an energy efficient and simple alternative to other separation techniques. In this work, a membrane comprised of an about 0.7$\mu$m thick MFI film on a graded alumina support was used to separate CO2from synthesis gas produced by pilot scale gasification of black liquor. The separation of CO2from the synthesis gas was carried out at a feed pressure of 2.25MPa, a permeate pressure of 0.3MPa and room temperature. In the beginning of the experiment, when the H2S concentration in the feed was 0.5{\%} and the concentration of water in the feed was 0.07{\%}, a CO2/H2separation factor of 10.4 and a CO2flux of 67.0kgm-2h-1were observed. However, as the H2S concentration in the feed to the membrane increased to 1.7{\%}, the CO2/H2separation factor and the CO2flux decreased to 5 and 61.4kgm-2h-1, respectively. The results suggest that MFI membranes are promising candidates for the separation of CO2from synthesis gas. {\textcopyright} 2013.},

abstract = {In this study, a highly permeable ceramic hollow fibre substrate has been fabricated for developing Pd composite membranes. The substrate consists of one thin outer sponge-like layer for depositing Pd membranes by electroless plating and a plurality of self-organized micro-channels for reducing gas permeation resistance. A dense defect-free Pd membrane with approximately 1 $\mu$m was formed on the outer surface of the sponge-like layer, which suggests a great uniformity of the substrate. As a result, a hydrogen permeation flux of 0.87 mol s−1 m−2 can be achieved at 450 °C and 165 KPa. Hydrogen permeation of the several composite membranes with different Pd thicknesses (1.0 and 3.3 $\mu$m) and different substrates sintered at different temperatures (1300 and 1400 °C) was also investigated. It was found that an intermediate layer, which is normally formed due to the Pd penetration during the electroless plating, shows an adverse effect in hydrogen permeation, especially when the Pd membrane is very thin.},

Activation of MFI zeolite membranes by air at 500 C was found to promote catalytic cracking deposition of silane in the zeolitic pores effectively, which resulted in significant improvement of H2-separating performance.

abstract = {In order to maximize peak capacity and detection sensitivity of fast gas chromatography (GC) separations, it is necessary to minimize band broadening, and in particular due to injection since this is often a major contributor. A high-speed cryo-focusing injection (HSCFI) system was constructed to first cryogenically focus analyte compounds in a 6 cm long section of metal MXT column, and second, reinject the focused analytes by rapidly resistively heating the metal column via an in-house built electronic circuit. Since the cryogenically cooled section of column is small (???750 nl) and the direct resistive heating is fast (???6000 ??C/s), HSCFI is demonstrated to produce an analyte peak with a 6.3 ms width at half height, w 1/2. This was achieved using a 1 m long column with a 180 ??m inner diameter (i.d.) operated at an absolute head pressure of 55 psi and an oven temperature of 60 ??C, with a 10 V pulse applied to the metal column for 50 ms. HSCFI was also used to demonstrate the head space sampling and fast GC analysis of an aqueous solution containing six test analytes (acetone, methanol, ethanol, toluene, chlorobenzene, pentanol). Using Henry's law constants for each of the analytes, injected mass limits of detection (LODs) were typically in the low pg levels (e.g., 1.2 pg for acetone) for the high speed separation. Finally, to demonstrate the use of HSCFI with a complex sample, a gasoline was separated using a 20 m??100 ??m i.d. column and the stock GC oven for temperature programming, which provided a separation time of 200 s and an average peak width at the base of 440 ms resulting in a total peak capacity of 460 peaks (at unit resolution). ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {An ordered mesoporous precursor synthesized by the soft-templating approach has successfully been used to prepare a carbon interlayer between the thin separation layer and the support of carbon membranes. Morphology and pore structure characteristics of the ordered mesoporous carbon (OMC) interlayer were investigated by HRTEM, XRD, SEM and N2adsorption techniques. Gas separation properties of resultant supported carbon membranes were evaluated by single gas permeation experiments. The results showed that the OMC interlayer can effectively reduce surface defects of the support with large pore sizes, improve the interfacial adhesion of the support to the thin separation layer, and further enhance the gas permeation properties of the supported carbon membranes by ordered and uniform mesoporous channels. The supported carbon membranes were synthesized by one-step coating on the support modified by the OMC interlayer and achieved O2, CO2and H2permeances of 74.5, 88.0 and 545.5molm-2s-1Pa-1×10-10, respectively. These are about 4 times higher than those without the interlayer and are very competitive with respect to other carbon membranes reported in literature. The results clearly indicate that this novel approach using the OMC as an interlayer to fabricate supported carbon membranes with macro-meso-microporous gradient structure have attractive potential for gas separation. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Palladium-based membranes for hydrogen separation have been studied by several research groups during the last 40 years. Much effort has been dedicated to improving the hydrogen flux of these membranes employing different alloys, supports, deposition/production techniques, etc. High flux and cheap membranes, yet stable at different operating conditions are required for their exploitation at industrial scale. The integration of membranes in multifunctional reactors (membrane reactors) poses additional demands on the membranes as interactions at different levels between the catalyst and the membrane surface can occur. Particularly, when employing the membranes in fluidized bed reactors, the selective layer should be resistant to or protected against erosion. In this review we will also describe a novel kind of membranes, the pore-filled type membranes prepared by Pacheco Tanaka and coworkers that represent a possible solution to integrate thin selective membranes into membrane reactors while protecting the selective layer. This work is focused on recent advances on metallic supports, materials used as an intermetallic diffusion layer when metallic supports are used and the most recent advances on Pd-based composite membranes. Particular attention is paid to improvements on sulfur resistance of Pd based membranes, resistance to hydrogen embrittlement and stability at high temperature.},

Membranes were synthesized with thicknesses of 4-12??m that contained up to 27wt{\%} Pt. Pd-Pt alloy membranes had lower pure-gas hydrogen flux compared with pure Pd membranes of equal thickness. However, when tested at 673K under an identical synthetic water-gas shift feed gas mixture composed of H2, H2O, CO2, and CO at 689.5kPa total pressure, the Pd-Pt alloy membranes had over 25{\%} higher hydrogen fluxes than a pure Pd membrane of similar thickness. Membrane films were analyzed after testing with SEM, EDS, and ICP-AES to corroborate membrane thickness and alloy compositions estimated by mass gain. SEM thickness estimates on membrane cross sections were similar to those estimated by mass gain. ICP-AES analysis was performed on two membranes and confirmed the composition estimated by gravimetric analysis. In five of six membranes the film composition estimated by gravimetric analysis was consistent with the surface composition estimated by EDS which indicated that the membranes had been adequately annealed. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The hydrogen permeation through surface modified Pd and Pd70Ag30 membranes has been studied at temperatures between 100 and 350°C. Silver has been evaporated on Pd and Pd70Ag30 foils with a thickness of 25$\mu$m in order to study the role of the surface composition in comparison with the membrane bulk composition. The Pd70Ag30-based membranes display the largest permeation rates at temperatures below 200°C, while Pd membranes with 20{\AA} silver evaporated on the upstream side show the largest permeation rates above 200°C. There are, consequently, different rate limiting processes above and below 200°C: at temperatures below 200°C, the bulk diffusion through the membrane is rate limiting, while at temperatures above 200°C, the influence of the surface composition starts to become significant. It has further been concluded that a sharp silver concentration gradient from the surface to the bulk is important for the hydrogen permeation rate at temperatures above 200°C. Adding oxygen to the hydrogen supply will almost totally inhibit the hydrogen permeation rate when a pure Pd membrane surface is facing the upstream side, while for silver-containing surfaces the presence of oxygen has almost no effect. On a clean Pd surface, oxygen effectively consumes adsorbed hydrogen in a water forming reaction. With Ag on the surface, no water formation is detected. Co-supplied CO inhibits the permeation of hydrogen in a similar manner on all studied membrane surfaces, independent of surface silver content. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

Electronic noses based on metal oxide semiconducting (MOS) sensors present a potential technology to create devices for such purposes. An array of four thick film MOS gas sensors was fabricated, based on zinc oxide inks. Production took place using a commercially available screen printer, a 3 ? 3 mm alumina substrate containing interdigitated electrodes and a platinum heater track. ZnO inks were modified using zeolite b, zeolite Y and mordenite admixtures. The sensors were exposed to four gases commonly found in the clandestine laboratory environment; these were nitrogen dioxide, ethanol, acetone and ammonia. Zeolite modification was found to increase the sensitivity of the sensor, compared to unmodified ZnO sensors, all of which showed strong responses to low ppm concentrations of acetone, ammonia and ethanol and to ppb concentrations of nitrogen dioxide. Machine learning techniques were incorporated to test the selectivity of the sensors. A high level of accuracy was achieved in determining the class of gas observed.},

abstract = {This work shows for the first time that the hydrothermal stability of cobalt oxide silica membranes is very dependent upon the cobalt oxide phase. Xerogels with the same cobalt loading (Co/Si=0.1) were characterised by N2sorption, CP/MAS29Si NMR, FTIR, Raman, XPS and DR UV-vis spectroscopy. It was found that the xerogels containing tetrahedrally coordinated cobalt (Co2+) in the silica matrix were hydrothermally unstable leading to a sharp loss of pore volume within 10h when exposed to 75mol{\%} water vapour and 550°C, followed by complete densification after 40h. However, silica xerogels containing a high content of octahedrally coordinated cobalt (Co3+) in the form of Co3O4were able to oppose structural densification and were consequently much more hydrothermally stable. The Co3O4and Co2+silica membranes were tested for single gas permeation using He, H2, CO2and N2, delivering similar He permeance (2.48 × 10-7and 2.85 × 10-7molm-2s-1Pa-1) and a He/N2selectivity of 50 and 41 at 500°C, respectively. Upon exposure to the same harsh hydrothermal conditions as the xerogels, the membranes were tested again for single gas permeation. The high content Co3O4silica membrane saw only a marginal decrease in He/N2selectivity to 39 (22{\%} loss) whilst the tetrahedral cobalt coordination silica membrane had a dramatic decline in selectivity to only 11 (73{\%} loss).},

abstract = {We present an investigation of molecular permeation of gases through nanoporous graphene membranes via molecular dynamics simulations; four different gases are investigated, namely helium, hydrogen, nitrogen, and methane. We show that in addition to the direct (gas-kinetic) flux of molecules crossing from the bulk phase on one side of the graphene to the bulk phase on the other side, for gases that adsorb onto the graphene, significant contribution to the flux across the membrane comes from a surface mechanism by which molecules cross after being adsorbed onto the graphene surface. Our results quantify the relative contribution of the bulk and surface mechanisms and show that the direct flux can be described reasonably accurately using kinetic theory, provided the latter is appropriately modified assuming steric molecule-pore interactions, with gas molecules behaving as hard spheres of known kinetic diameters. The surface flux is negligible for gases that do not adsorb onto graphene (e.g., He and H2), while for gases that adsorb (e.g., CH4 and N2) it can be on the order of the direct flux or larger. Our results identify a nanopore geometry that is permeable to hydrogen and helium, is significantly less permeable to nitrogen, and is essentially impermeable to methane, thus validating previous suggestions that nanoporous graphene membranes can be used for gas separation. We also show that molecular permeation is strongly affected by pore functionalization; this observation may be sufficient to explain the large discrepancy between simulated and experimentally measured transport rates through nanoporous graphene membranes.},

Known as reactive air brazing, this joining method is currently being considered for use in sealing various high-temperature solid-state electrochemical devices, including planar solid oxide fuel cells (pSOFC). In order to simulate a typical pSOFC application, test specimens were prepared by joining ceramic anode/electrolyte bilayers to metal washers, of the same composition as the common frame materials employed in pSOFC stacks, using a filler metal composed of 4 mol{\%} CuO in silver. The brazed samples were exposure tested at 750 ??C for 200, 400, and 800 h in both simulated fuel and air environments and thermally cycled at rapid rate (75 ??C min-1) between room temperature and 750 ??C for as many as 50 cycles. Subsequent joint strength testing and microstructural analysis indicated that the samples exposure tested in air displayed little degradation with respect to strength, hermeticity, or microstructure out to 800 h of exposure. Those tested in fuel showed no change in rupture strength or loss in hermeticity after 800 h of high-temperature exposure, but did undergo microstructural change due to the dissolution of hydrogen into the silver-based braze material. Air-brazed specimens subjected to rapid thermal cycling exhibited no loss in joint strength or hermeticity, but displayed initial signs of seal delamination along the braze-electrolyte interface after 50 cycles.},

abstract = {Four iridium(III)-containing coordination polymers 1–4 using Ir(ppy)2(H2dcbpy)PF6 (L-H2, ppy = 2-phenylpyridine, H2dcbpy = 4,4′-dicarboxy-2,2′-bipyridine) as the bridging ligand, [ZnL2]{\textperiodcentered}3DMF{\textperiodcentered}5H2O (1), [CdL2(H2O)2]{\textperiodcentered}3DMF{\textperiodcentered}6H2O (2), [CoL2(H2O)2]{\textperiodcentered}2DMF{\textperiodcentered}8H2O (3) and [NiL2(H2O)2]{\textperiodcentered}3DMF{\textperiodcentered}6H2O (4), have been synthesized and structurally characterized. The emissions from 1–4 are ascribed to a metal-to-ligand charge transfer transition (MLCT). The absolute emission quantum yields for 1–4 in single crystals were measured in air to be 0.274, 0.193, 0.001 and 0.002, respectively. The noteworthy oxygen-sensing properties of 1–4 as well as L-H2 in a single crystal were also evaluated. The Stern–Volmer quenching constant, KSV values, of 1–4 and L-H2 can be deduced to be 0.834, 2.820, 1.328, 1.111 and 2.476, respectively. The results show promising KSV values (e.g.2) that are competitive or even larger than those of many known Ir-complexes. Moreover, the short response time (e.g. compound 2) and recovery times toward oxygen of 1–4 have been measured in their single crystal forms. The reversibility experiments for 1–4 were carried out for seven repeated cycles. As a result, {\textgreater}75{\%} recovery of intensity for 1 and 2 on each cycle demonstrates a high degree of reproducibility during the sensing process. It should be noted that iridium(III)-containing coordination polymers with high emission intensity and notable oxygen sensing properties are obscure, especially in the single crystal form. This, in combination with its fine reversibility, leads to success in single crystal oxygen recognition based on photoluminescence imaging. The detection limit could be 0.50{\%} for gaseous oxygen. Moreover, the temperature effect of compound 2 in a single crystal upon application as an oxygen sensor was expected.},

abstract = {A highly hydrogen permselective composite silica membrane was obtained by depositing a thin silica layer on a porous alumina support by the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) of tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS) at 873K in inert gas at atmospheric pressure. The silica/alumina membrane showed a high hydrogen permeance (???10-7molm-2s-1Pa-1) with selectivity over CH4, CO, and CO2 in excess of 1000 at 873K. Cross-sectional and surface images of the membranes obtained from scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) showed that the silica film deposited on the ??-Al2O3 support was uniform with a thickness of 20-30nm. This indicated that the high temperature thermal decomposition of tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS) used in this work was excellent in controlling the uniformity and thickness of the silica film formed on the porous alumina support. On the fresh alumina support the permeance of gases (He, H2, CH4, CO, and CO 2) decreased with temperature and molecular weight in agreement with a Knudsen transport mechanism. However, on the silica/alumina membrane the permeation of H2 and He was activated and increased with temperature. The transport mechanism for the small gas molecules (H2 and He) through the silica membrane was analyzed using a permeation mechanism which involves the jumping of the diffusing molecules between adjacent solubility sites. The model analysis indicated that the structure of the silica layer is more open than that of vitreous silica glass, with larger interconnecting passageways and low activation energies for permeation, allowing for easier gas diffusion. ?? 2003 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Hydrogen-based energy is a promising renewable and clean resource. Thus, hydrogen selective microporous membranes with high performance and high stability are demanded. Novel NH2-MIL-53(Al) membranes are evaluated for hydrogen separation for this goal. Continuous NH2-MIL-53(Al) membranes have been prepared successfully on macroporous glass frit discs assisted with colloidal seeds. The gas sorption ability of NH2-MIL-53(Al) materials is studied by gas adsorption measurement. The isosteric heats of adsorption in a sequence of CO2 {\textgreater} N2 {\textgreater} CH4 H2 indicates different interactions between NH2-MIL-53(Al) framework and these gases. As-prepared membranes are measured by single and binary gas permeation at different temperatures. The results of singe gas permeation show a decreasing permeance in an order of H2 {\textgreater} CH4 {\textgreater} N2 {\textgreater} CO2, suggesting that the diffusion and adsorption properties make significant contributions in the gas permeation through the membrane. In binary gas permeation, the NH2-MIL-53(Al) membrane shows high selectivity for H2 with separation factors of 20.7, 23.9 and 30.9 at room temperature (288 K) for H2 over CH4, N2 and CO2, respectively. In comparison to single gas permeation, a slightly higher separation factor is obtained due to the competitive adsorption effect between the gases in the porous MOF membrane. Additionally, the NH2-MIL-53(Al) membrane exhibits very high permeance for H2 in the mixtures separation (above 1.5 x 10-6 mol m-2 s-1 Pa-1) due to its large cavity, resulting in a very high separation power. The details of the temperature effect on the permeances of H2 over other gases are investigated from 288 to 353 K. The supported NH2-MIL-53(Al) membranes with high hydrogen separation power possess high stability, resistance to cracking, temperature cycling and show high reproducibility, necessary for the potential application to hydrogen recycling.},

abstract = {Rubbery polymeric membranes demonstrate potential in gas separation as they can be selective for carbon dioxide over less condensable gases such as hydrogen. In many industrial processes where these membranes are applicable, minor gas components such as carbon monoxide, hydrogen sulfide and water are present. Here, the effect of these minor components on the performance of a polydimethyl siloxane rubbery membrane in CO2/N2 separation is experimentally determined. The permeability of CO2 through PDMS is reduced upon exposure to CO, H2S and water, due to competitive sorption of these gases into the polymeric matrix. Similar behavior is observed for N2; however the presence of H2S gives rise to an observed increase in N2 permeability. Extension of the Flory-Huggins theory to a quaternary system allows the relevant interaction parameters for this system to be determined. Upon exposure to a wet feed, CO2 and N2 permeability decrease due to water occupying free volume within PDMS, with the Flory-Huggins interaction parameters indicating mixing of CO2 or N2 with water within PDMS is highly unfavorable. Quantitative analysis of the change in permeability of CO2 and N2 in PDMS in the presence of these minor components enables more accurate prediction of membrane performance in industrial applications to be undertaken. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The effect of the pyrolysis environment on the structure and properties of the produced membranes, both on inert (N2) and reactive (CO2and H2O) conditions, have been examined by a carbonization process up to 900 °C. The surface structure and morphological characteristics were investigated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The produced carbon fibers exhibit H2permeance varying from 20 to 52 GPU with a highest H2/CH4permselectivity coefficient of 137 (M3) and very high H2/CO2permselectivity coefficient of 37.82 (M1). Permeation rates of He, H2, Ar, CH4, CO2, CO, O2and N2at variable pressure were measured too. The porosity of the developed membranes was estimated by nitrogen adsorption at 77 K. The results suggest that the formation of the selective layer on the fibers is independent from the initial orientation of the asymmetric polyimide precursor. The size of the pores is influenced by the temperature of the carbonization process whereas the pore volume by the pyrolysis environment conditions. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

The model presented in this paper is expanded to take into account water electrolysis technology driven by solar and wind energy. Two scenarios are evaluated, including a full range of technologies and “green” technologies using only renewable resources. The resulting model is a mixed integer linear program (MILP) that is solved with the Advanced Integrated Multidimensional Modeling System (AIMMS).

abstract = {Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) are a class of hybrid materials with unique optical and electronic properties arising from rational self-assembly of the organic linkers and metal ions/clusters, yielding myriads of possible structural motifs. The combination of order and chemical tunability, coupled with good environmental stability of MOFs, are prompting many research groups to explore the possibility of incorporating these materials as active components in devices such as solar cells, photodetectors, radiation detectors, and chemical sensors. Although this field is only in its incipiency, many new fundamental insights relevant to integrating MOFs with such devices have already been gained. In this review, we focus our attention on the basic requirements and structural elements needed to fabricate MOF-based devices and summarize the current state of MOF research in the area of electronic, opto-electronic and sensor devices. We summarize various approaches to designing active MOFs, creation of hybrid material systems combining MOFs with other materials, and assembly and integration of MOFs with device hardware. Critical directions of future research are identified, with emphasis on achieving the desired MOF functionality in a device and establishing the structure–property relationships to identify and rationalize the factors that impact device performance.},

abstract = {Thin Pd-Cu membranes were prepared by electroless plating technique on porous stainless steel (PSS) disks coated with a mesoporous palladium impregnated zirconia intermediate layer. This intermediate layer provides seeds for electroless plating growth of Pd-Cu film during synthesis and serves as an inter-metallic diffusion barrier that improves membrane stability for practical application. XPS analyses showed that the average surface compositions of the two membranes were respectively Pd84Cu16 and Pd 46Cu54 (at.{\%}). XRD analyses indicated that deposited Pd84Cu16 alloy film contained only ??-fcc (face-centred cubic) phase structure whereas Pd46Cu54 alloy film contained a mixture of ??-fcc and ??-bcc phases. The 10 ??m thick Pd46Cu54/ZrO2-PSS membrane exhibited an infinite separation factor for H2 over N2, with H2 permeance of 1.1 ?? 10-7 mol/m2 s Pa at 753 K. The activation energies for hydrogen permeation and hydrogen pressure exponents are respectively 14.5 kJ/mol and 0.6 for Pd 84Cu16/ZrO2-PSS membrane and 15.4 kJ/mol and 1 for Pd46Cu54/ZrO2-PSS composite membrane. The different permeation properties for the two membranes are discussed in terms of different permeation mechanisms associated with membrane thickness, structure, surface composition and morphology. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V.

In this tutorial review, a progress report on the postsynthetic modification (PSM) of MOFs is provided. PSM refers to the chemical modification of the MOF lattice in a heterogeneous fashion. This powerful synthetic approach has grown in popularity and resulted in a number of advances in the functionalization and application of MOFs. The use of PSM to develop MOFs with improved gas sorption, catalytic activity, bioactivity, and more robust physical properties is discussed. The results reported to date clearly show that PSM is an important approach for the development and advancement of these hybrid solids.},

abstract = {We report an experimental investigation of the adsorption properties of two important small-pore metal-organic framework (MOF) materials recently identified for gas separation applications, through the development and use of a high-pressure/high-temperature quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) device. In particular, we characterize in detail the CO2, CH4, and N-2 adsorption characteristics of the MOFs Cu(4,4'-(hexafluoroisopropylidene)bisbenzoate)(1.5) (referred to as Cu-hfipbb) and zeolitic imidazolate framework-90 (ZIF-90). We first describe the construction of a QCM-based adsorption measurement apparatus. Single-component adsorption isotherms of CO2, CH4, and N-2 in the two MOFs were then measured at temperatures ranging from 30 to 70 C and pressures ranging from 0.3 to 110 psi. In both materials, the order of adsorption strength is CO2 {\textgreater} CH4 {\textgreater} N-2. We find that adsorption in the 1-D channels of Cu-hfipbb can be well described by a single-site Langmuir model. On the other hand, adsorption in ZIF-90 follows a more complex behavior, commensurate with its pore structure consisting of large porous cages connected in three dimensions by small windows. The nongravimetric QCM-based measurement techniques are shown to be a valuable microanalytical tool for the study of molecular adsorption in MOFs.},

The pores on the graphene sheets may contribute to the improved mass transfer and may show potential applications in many fields. To date, the preparation of porous graphene includes chemical bottom-up approach via the aryl-aryl coupling reaction and physical preparation by high-energy techniques, and is generally conducted on substrates with limited yields. Here we show a general and scalable synthesis method for porous graphene that is developed through the carbothermal reaction between graphene and metal oxide nanoparticles produced from oxometalates or polyoxometalates. The pore formation process is observed in situ with the assistance of an electron beam. Pore engineering on graphene is conducted by controlling the pore size and/or the nitrogen doping on the porous graphene sheets by varying the amount of the oxometalates or polyoxometalates, or using ammonium-containing oxometalates or polyoxometalates.},

abstract = {Carbon molecular sieve (CMS) membranes were prepared by controlled pyrolysis of polyetherimide (PEI) blended with polyimide (PI). The microstructure and gas separation properties of the precursor membranes and supported CMS membranes were characterized in terms of the different weight ratios of PI to PEI. The thermogravimetric analysis indicated that the co-pyrolysis in the PEI/PI appeared above 450 {\"{i}}¿½C. Both permeability and selectivity of supported CMS membranes increased with increasing PI content in the precursors. The positron annihilation lifetime (PAL) results showed that the free volume size and the pore size were enhanced as the PI content is increased and that there is a close relationship between the microstructures of polymer blend precursors and CMS membranes. These results confirmed that the microstructure and gas separation performance of CMS membranes can be adjusted by blending two thermally stable polymers. For CMS membrane derived from a precursor containing 75 wt{\%} PI and pyrolyzed at 700 {\"{i}}¿½C, the gas permeance for CO2was 40 GPU and CO2/N2selectivity was 39.},

The ZIF-8 film was characterized by scanning electron microscopy. The thickness and refractive index (RI) of films deposited after 1,2,3,5 and 10 growth cycles were determined by using an ellipsometer. The crystallinity of the films was confirmed by X-ray diffraction pattern. The LPG was designed to operate at the phase matching turning point to provide the highest sensitivity. The sensing mechanism is based on the measurement of the change in the RI of the film induced by the penetration of the chemical molecules into the ZIF-8 pores. The responses of LPGs modified with 2 and 5 growth cycles of ZIF-8 to exposure to methanol, ethanol, 2-propanol and acetone were characterised.

abstract = {In this study, water stable zirconium metal-organic framework (UiO-66) has been synthesized and for the first time applied as an adsorbent to remove aquatic arsenic contamination. The as-synthesized UiO-66 adsorbent functions excellently across a broad pH range of 1 to 10, and achieves a remarkable arsenate uptake capacity of 303 mg/g at the optimal pH, i.e., pH = 2. To the best of our knowledge, this is the highest arsenate As(V) adsorption capacity ever reported, much higher than that of currently available adsorbents (5-280 mg/g, generally less than 100 mg/g). The superior arsenic uptake performance of UiO-66 adsorbent could be attributed to the highly porous crystalline structure containing zirconium oxide clusters, which provides a large contact area and plenty of active sites in unit space. Two binding sites within the adsorbent framework are proposed for arsenic species, i.e., hydroxyl group and benzenedicarboxylate ligand. At equilibrium, seven equivalent arsenic species can be captured by one Zr6 cluster through the formation of Zr-O-As coordination bonds.},

A well-defined second stage is observed in hydrogen permeation curves of the Fe3Al alloy superimposed on the basic curves. On the basis of optical microstructures, determined permeabilities and diffusivities, corresponding activation energies, it is suggested that the two sigmoidal curves result from the ordered B 2 phase and disordered ??-Fe phase in the Fe3Al alloy; the first stage of permeation reflects the hydrogen transport in matrix disordered ??-Fe phase, while the second stage reflects the hydrogen transport in ordered B2 phase. ?? 2004 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Coal is potentially a very inexpensive source of clean hydrogen fuel for use in fuel cells, turbines, and various process applications. To realize its potential however, efficient low-cost gas separation systems are needed to provide high purity oxygen that will enhance the coal gasification reaction and to extract hydrogen from the resulting gas product stream. Several types of inorganic membranes are being developed for hydrogen or oxygen separation, including porous alumina, transition metal oxide perovskites, and zirconia. Because they form the heart of the working device, numerous advances have been made in the fabrication and performance of these membrane materials. However, less emphasis has been placed on the materials that will be used in the balance of the device; in particular, the seals that bond the functional ceramic to the metallic structural component. In an effort to begin addressing this issue, we have examined ceramic-to-metal brazing as a method of sealing a model set of gas separation component materials: yttria-stabilized zirconia and stainless steel. In comparative high-temperature exposure testing of joints prepared using commercial brazes and a newly conceived braze alloy, the commercial material proved to be unsuitable due to excessive oxidation. On the other hand, the new material not only displayed superior oxidation resistance, but also excellent hermeticity in prototypic membrane testing. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The SnO2 QW/rGO nanocomposites well-dispersed in ethanol were spin-coated onto ceramics substrates to construct chemiresistive gas sensors. The H2S-sensing isotherm curves were obtained based on the real-time response curves of the SnO2 QW/rGO gas sensors when operated at different temperatures ranging from 30??C to 70??C, from which the adsorbing/sensing performance of the specific materials were extracted and the kinetic parameters (such as response rate constant k and activation energy Ea ) of the sensing-materials were quantitatively modeled. The H2S-sensing mechanism was found to follow Langmuir isotherm and pseudo-first-order model. Compared to pure SnO2 QW sensors, the SnO2 QW/rGO gas sensors exhibited higher sensitivity and faster response rate toward H2S, which was attributed to its lower activation energy. The SnO2 QW/rGO gas sensors can even detect H2S at room temperature, highly attractive for the detection of H2S detection with lower power consumption.},

Accompanying this applied focus has been a recognition of the need to engender MOFs with mechanical, thermal and/or chemical stability. Chemical stability in acidic, basic and neutral aqueous solutions is important. Advances over recent years have made it possible to design MOFs that possess different combinations of mechanical, thermal and chemical stability. Here, we review these advances and the associated design principles and synthesis strategies. We focus on how these advances may render MOFs effective as heterogeneous catalysts, both in chemically harsh condensed phases and in thermally challenging conditions relevant to gas-phase reactions. Finally, we briefly discuss future directions of study for the production of highly stable MOFs.},

GO is not a new material but its unique features have recently been of interest for gas sensing applications, and not just as an intermediate for reduced graphene oxide (RGO). Graphene and RGO have been well known gas-sensing materials, but GO is also an attractive sensing material that has been well studied these last few years. The functional groups on GO nanosheets play important roles in adsorbing gas molecules, and the electric or optical properties of GO materials change with exposure to certain gases. Addition of metal nanoparticles and metal oxide nanocomposites is an effective way to make GO materials selective and sensitive to analyte gases. In this paper, several applications of GO based sensors are summarized for detection of water vapor, NO{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}, H{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}, NH{\textless}inf{\textgreater}3{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}, H{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}S, and organic vapors.

Palladium-base membrane is known to have high selectivity and stability for hydrogen separation.

Palladium membrane supported on a porous alumina prepared by electroless plating is the promising method to provide good hydrogen permeability. The alumina tube substrate was pre-seeded by immersing in the palladium acetate solution and followed by reduction in the alkaline hydrazine solution. After that, the deposition of palladium membrane could be achieved from the plating bath containing ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) stabilized palladium complex and hydrazine. The morphology of palladium film was observed to progress as a function of plating time and a dense layer membrane was available after plating for 3 h. The porosity of ceramic support exhibited an effect on the microstructure of deposited film such that the support with low porosity tended to achieve a defect free palladium membrane. ?? 2010 The Chinese Society for Metals.},

abstract = {While the dominant role of hydrogen in a sustainable energy future is widely accepted, the strategies for the transition from fossil-based to hydrogen economy are still actively debated. This paper emphasizes the role of carbon-neutral technologies and fuels during the transition period. To satisfy the world's growing appetite for energy and keep our planet healthy, at least 10TW (or terawatt) of carbon-free power has to be produced by mid-century. Three prominent options discussed in the literature include: decarbonization of fossil energy, nuclear energy and renewable energy sources. These options are analyzed in this paper with a special emphasis on the role of hydrogen as a carbon-free energy carrier. In particular, the authors compare various fossil decarbonization strategies and evaluate the potential of nuclear and renewable energy resources to meet the 10TW target. An overview of state-of-the-art technologies for production of carbon-free energy carriers and transportation fuels, and the assessment of their commercial potential is provided. It is shown that neither of these three options alone could provide 10TW of carbon-neutral power without major changes in the existing infrastructure, and/or technological breakthroughs in many areas, and/or a considerable environmental risk. The authors propose a scenario for the transition from current fossil-based to hydrogen economy that includes two key elements: (i) changing the fossil decarbonization strategy from one based on CO2 sequestration to one that involves sequestration and/or utilization of solid carbon, and (ii) producing carbon-neutral synthetic fuels from bio-carbon and hydrogen generated from water using carbon-free sources (nuclear, solar, wind, geothermal). This strategy would allow taking advantage of the existing fuel infrastructure without an adverse environmental impact, and it would secure a smooth carbon-neutral transition from fossil-based to future hydrogen economy.},

As has been shown previously by the author, the decomposition of solids, in particular, metal nitrates, occurs through the congruent gasification of all reaction products, irrespective of their saturated pressure (with the simultaneous condensation of low-volatility species). In the interval between gasification and condensation, these species could diffuse for some distance from the primary site. An application of the method of absolute reaction rates (the Hertz-Langmuir vaporization models) to the kinetics of analyte release in the presence of a palladium modifier permits the interpretation of the retention mechanism as dissociative chemisorption. The experimental data from the literature (the appearance temperatures and activation energies for Ag, As, Au, Bi, Cd, Cu, Se and Tl) were used in these calculations.},

Single dry gas testing prior to reaction showed He/N2and H2/CO2selectivities increasing from 75-400 to 45-160 as the temperature increased from 100 to 250 °C, respectively. During reaction the membrane delivered a H2permeation purity of 89-95{\%} at high conversions, with the higher water ratio conversion providing superior membrane operational performance. Characterisation of bulk gels indicated that the cobalt silica was hydrophilic and exposure to steam at 200 °C resulted in the densification of the film matrix. The cobalt doping allowed for the membrane structural microporosity to be maintained as H2selectivity was not affected by steam exposure, though the flux decreased due to pore collapse of the film matrix. A total of 8 thermal cycle testing were carried out from room temperature to 300 °C, and the membrane displayed good hydrothermal stability, maintaining a high H2selectivity for over 200 h of operation. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Abstract This work investigates the performance of iron cobalt oxide silica membranes for the separation of binary gas mixtures containing H{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} and Ar up to 500 °C. A series of membranes were prepared by fixing the iron/cobalt molar ratio at 10/90, 25/75 and 50/50. H{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} preferentially permeated though the membranes, and H{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} purity in the permeate stream increased with temperature for all H{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}/Ar binary gas mixtures. The fluxes of H{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} from binary gas mixtures complied, for the most part, with a temperature dependent transport mechanism, similar to that delivered by single gas permeation. However, it was notable to observe a "transition point" where H{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} purity versus H{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} flux clearly changed from temperature independent to temperature dependent. This gas separation transition point was also found to be a function of the quality of the membrane. Indeed the best performing membrane (Fe/Co = 10/90) also had the highest gas separation transition point at ∼70{\%} H{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} purity. This reduced to ∼60{\%} for the medium quality membrane (Fe/Co = 25/75) and was at its lowest ∼43{\%} for the lower quality membrane (Fe/Co = 50/50). The binary gas fractions therefore affect the H{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} fluxes and H{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} purity more significantly than that expected in single gas permeation. Therefore, the relationship between membrane quality and gas separation transition point is established for the first time in this work.},

abstract = {The objective of this work was to fabricate palladium membranes with a Pd/Cu alloy top layer and to investigate the performance and long-term stability of the membranes in small concentrations of H2S. The Pd/Cu alloy membranes with compositions of 8, 18, and 19 wt {\%} copper were fabricated using the electroless deposition method on porous Inconel supports and characterized for several thousand hours in H2, helium, and 45-55 ppm H 2S/H2 mixtures in the temperature range of 350-500°C. Upon exposure to the H2S/H2 mixture at 500°C, the Pd/Cu membranes lost ∼80{\%} of the hydrogen permeance, because of the H 2S forming surface sulfides and blocking H2 adsorption sites, with the amount of permeance lost increasing with decreasing temperature. Reintroducing pure H2 recovered some of the hydrogen permeance, showing that some of the H2S poisoning was irreversible. The amount of irreversible poisoning increased as the H2S exposure time increased and the exposure temperature decreased, because of the exothermic nature of H2S adsorption. The helium leak rate of the Pd/Cu membranes decreased after the poisoning experiments, possibly because of sulfur that segregated to the grain boundaries of the Pd/Cu deposits. {\textcopyright} 2009 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {A new type of nanoscale coordination particles (NCPs) are successfully synthesized on a large scale through a coordination-induced self-assembling process. The as-prepared NCPs exhibit fascinating fluorescence properties including large stokes shifts, strong photoluminescence (PL) intensity, high photochemical stability, as well as tunable emission spectra. Excitingly, this new type of NCPs enable rapid, sensitive and modification-free detection of H2S as its fluorescence can be selectively quenched in the presence of H2S. With this NCPs-based detection system, the lowest concentration to quantify H2S can be down to 2 ppm, which is five times lower than the permissible exposure limit value set by the US National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH). Importantly, NCPs can serve as ‘inks' for writeable detection of H2S. The ability to directly write the H2S-sensitive NCPs under ambient conditions is really convenient and offers promising perspectives for real-time monitoring H2S.},

The PCT curves for the $\beta$ phase (V2H or VH) are measured using an electrochemical method. It is found that the logarithm of the plateau pressure for the V2H and the VH phases change almost linearly with the amount of alloying element in vanadium metal. Also, when the Ti/Cr compositional ratio is fixed at 1, the equilibrium hydrogen pressure increases for the V2H phase but decreases for the VH phase with increasing total content of Ti and Cr. However, both the V2H and the VH phases become unstable with decreasing Ti/Cr compositional ratio, so that the PCT curve shifts towards the lower H/M side and the second plateau region for the VH2phase existing at high hydrogen pressures spreads to some extent, which leads to the improvement in the effective hydrogen capacity of the alloy. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Twelve different metals were substituted in Pd(1 1 1) slabs at a level of 5{\{}{\%}{\}}: Ag, Au, Cd, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb, Pt, Rh, Ru, and Sn. The segregation energy (the difference in calculated total free energy between surface sites and bulk-like sites) was calculated for each alloy, and the results were in very good agreement with experimental data where available. Particularly, we predict an oscillatory depth profile for Cu and Ni, similar to what has been found experimentally for the PdNi(1 0 0) surface. There are more or less pronounced correlations between the segregation energy and the relaxed position at the surface of the substituted atom, the metal radius of the substituted atom, and the experimental surface energy of the metal. It is proposed that the segregation energy is an indirect measure of the stability of Pd based hydrogen permeable membranes. {\{}{\textcopyright}{\}} 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract  ="A lot of research attention has been paid to designing and exploring efficient adsorbents for HCHO adsorption and decomposition. Herein{,} we have demonstrated a highly active material{,} WC{,} for HCHO adsorption through first-principles calculations. Due to the exposed three-coordinated W atoms (W3c) of the WC (0001) surface{,} HCHO molecules can be settled on the WC (0001) surface through newly formed OF–W3c and/or CF–W3c bonds{,} forming different adsorption configurations. When settled on the WC (0001) surface{,} the molecular configuration of the HCHO molecule and the corresponding CF–HF and CF–OF bond lengths would be greatly changed. Due to the enlarged CF–HF and CF–OF bond lengths{,} the adsorbed HCHO molecules tend to dissociate through two possible pathways; these are the two-step CF–HF bond scission or the one-step CF–OF bond scission. The former results in two H adatoms and a CO molecule chemisorbed to the surface and the latter produces an O adatom and a CH2 group on the surface. Further Cl-NEB calculations demonstrate that the pre-adsorbed O atom has little influence on the first CF–HF bond scission and the CF–OF bond scission{,} while promoting the second CF–HF bond scission. Considering the dissociative products{,} H and CH2 have the potential to couple into a CH3 group (or even a CH4 molecule) and two CH2 groups may couple into a C2H4 molecule. In the end{,} we propose that OH ions may couple with the dissociative products of HCHO{,} so an alkali solution could be used to post-process the WC (0001) surface to restore its surface active sites. These results demonstrated the potential of WC in HCHO sensing and abatement."}

The dual path mechanism for HCOOH oxidation has been verified. The ability of Pt, Rh, Ir and Au to adsorb reaction intermediates in varying degrees has been demonstrated, together with the suggestion that the ability to chemisorb intermediates is connected with the ability to support a reaction between HCOOH and M-oxide species. It has been shown that Pd cannot adsorb COH and does not form a chemisorbed intermediate during HCOOH oxidation. This, combined with previous results, implies that COH is a major constituent of the chemisorbed intermediate formed on the other metals. The unique behaviour of Ir, having a qusi-reversible oxide region which is uniformly active towards HCOOh oxidation has been demonstrated, but not explained. The relative activities of the Pt metals and Au displayed volcano-type behaviour when correlated with the heat of formation of formate. A linear relation (with the exception of Ir) has been found between the catalytic activities of the metals towards the electro-oxidation of HCOOH and HCOOH decomposition in the gas phase."

The low thresholds in ISO 14687-2 for oxygen and water can be exceeded if the sampling procedure fails to purge the system sufficiently, which would lead to false results (60% in this study). Purging requirements to remove water were studied using a low pressure sampling rig. For hydrogen dispenser sampling using the Linde H2 Qualitizer (suitable for dispensing pressures up to 70 MPa), purging number and the effect of the initial fill level of a vehicle compressed hydrogen storage system were investigated experimentally to avoid hydrogen quality violation due to oxygen false positive. The study procedure reduces from 60% to 0% hydrogen quality violation. The next challenges highlighted are safe purging and reliable sampling of reactive contaminants in gas cylinders."

We investigated various reaction paths for each step including the energy barrier based on the climb image nudged elastic band (CI-NEB) method{,} and the complete reaction pathway was computed as the minimum energy path (MEP). The adsorption characteristics of nitrogen (N) and molecular nitrogen (N2) indicate that nitrogen atoms and molecules are energetically favorable at the hollow sites on pure Fe(100) and (110). The dissociation of the nitrogen molecule (N2) was theoretically supported by electronic structure calculations. The penetration of nitrogen from the surface to the sub-surface has a large energy barrier compared with the other steps. The activation energy calculated for nitrogen diffusion in pure bcc Fe was in good agreement with the experimental results. Finally{,} we confirmed the rate-determining step for the full nitridation reaction pathway. This study provides fundamental insight into the nitridation mechanism for nitrogen molecules in pure bcc Fe."}

Our predicted H solubility and permeability results are in reasonable agreement with experimental measurements. The proposed model is quite general and can be employed to rapidly and accurately screen a large number of alloy compositions for potential membrane applications. Extension to ternary or higher-order alloy systems should be straightforward. Our study also highlights the significant effect of local lattice relaxations on H energetics in size-mismatched disordered alloys, which has been largely overlooked in the literature. ?? 2012 Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

abstract = {The adsorption of benzene on metal surfaces is an important benchmark system for hybrid inorganic/organic interfaces. The reliable determination of the interface geometry and binding energy presents a significant challenge for both theory and experiment. Using the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE), PBE + vdW (van der Waals) and the recently developed PBE + vdW surf (density-functional theory with vdW interactions that include the collective electronic response of the substrate) methods, we calculated the structures and energetics for benzene on transition-metal surfaces: Cu, Ag, Au, Pd, Pt, Rh and Ir. Our calculations demonstrate that vdW interactions increase the binding energy by more than 0.70 eV for physisorbed systems (Cu, Ag and Au) and by an even larger amount for strongly bound systems (Pd, Pt, Rh and Ir). The collective response of the substrate electrons captured via the vdW surf method plays a significant role for most substrates, shortening the equilibrium distance by 0.25 {\AA} for Cu and decreasing the binding energy by 0.27 eV for Rh. The reliability of our results is assessed by comparison with calculations using the random-phase approximation including renormalized single excitations, and the experimental data from temperature-programmed desorption, microcalorimetry measurements and low-energy electron diffraction.},

abstract = {Mixed electronic- and protonic-conducting composites made up of physical mixtures of La5.5WO11.25−$\delta$–La0.87Sr0.13CrO3−$\delta$ (LWO–LSC) have been evaluated as H2 separation membranes for operation at temperatures greater than 550 °C. The mixture of these two ion-conducting phases led to non-linear synergetic effects; i.e. unexpected enhancement of the total conductivity and well-balanced ambipolar conductivity, resulting in appealing H2 permeation fluxes through robust ceramic membranes. The preparation, primary characterization, H2 permeation and stability studies of various composites is presented. Mixing LWO and LSC phases makes it possible (1) to improve the LSC sintering behavior and to achieve very high membrane densities and (2) to obtain compounds with high total conductivity, higher than that shown for LWO and LSC, separately. The highest permeation rate is achieved for the 50 vol{\%}-LWO–LSC membrane, though other composite compositions showed higher total conductivity. Moreover, the influence on the H2 permeation of the composite composition, the humidification of gas streams, temperature and the use of various catalytic coatings on the membrane surface is evaluated. The nature of the transport mechanism is investigated by the permeation studies using deuterium tracers. The H2 permeation rates reported in this investigation for a 370 $\mu$m thick 50 vol{\%}-LWO–LSC membrane, e.g. 0.15 mL min−1 cm−2 at 700 °C, are the highest reported values, up to date, for any bulk mixed protonic-electronic membranes. The H2 permeation magnitude achieved at moderate temperatures along with the proven stability in CO2-rich atmospheres are firm steps towards the future application of this type of membrane for industrial processes.},

abstract = {Blends of an acetylene-terminated monomer (ATM) with a commercially available poly(etherimide) (PEI, Ultem(TM)) were prepared, crosslinked, and characterized. Varying degrees of crosslinking were achieved through thermal treatment at 150-270°C. Incorporation of the uncrosslinked additive into the PEI resulted in reductions in the glass transition temperature, gas permeabilities and selectivities, and thermal stability. These behavior are consistent with antiplasticization of the polymer host by the ATM additive. Crosslinking of the actylene-terminated additive led to increases in thermal and chemical stability and improved gas selectivities as compared to the uncrosslinked blend. Gas transport properties are reported as a function of temperature. For the blend composition considered (9wt{\%} ATM in PEI), the fully crosslinked blend had transport properties which were essentially equivalent to the virgin PEI. Further, processing of the blend could be achieved in the same manner as for the virgin PEI. The resistance of the crosslinked blend to chemical dissolution or swelling was markedly improved as compared to PEI. Copyright (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.},

In addition, studies by X-ray diffraction (XRD), extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy, and X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy showed that the resulting Pd(3)Ag nanoparticles inherited similar atomic ratio and alloy structure as the starting material.

abstract = {Because of poor heterogeneous nucleation of MOF on the ceramic support surface, it is usually difficult to prepare defect-free metal-organic framework (MOF) layers as shape-selective membrane on the native ceramic supports by a direct solvothermal synthesis route. In the present work, inspired by “like dissolves like” principle, a simple and facile synthesis strategy was developed to prepare highly reproducible and permselective zeolitic imidazolate framework ZIF-8 membranes on the 1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluoroalkyltriethoxysilanes (POTS) modified $\alpha$-Al2O3disks. Attributing to the enhancement of surface hydrophobicity of the $\alpha$-Al2O3supports after POTS modification, hydrophobic ZIF-8 membranes are tending to grow well on the hydrophobic surface following the “like grows like” principle. Thus a well-intergrown ZIF-8 membrane with a thickness of about 20 µm has formed on the POTS-modified $\alpha$-Al2O3disks. The developed ZIF-8 membranes show high hydrogen selectivity and thermal stability. At 200 °C and 1 bar, the mixture separation factors of H2/CO2, H2/N2, H2/CH4, and H2/C3H8are 15.8, 22.6, 40.6, and 549.3, with H2permeances higher than 2.1 × 10−7mol{\textperiodcentered}m−2{\textperiodcentered}s−1{\textperiodcentered}Pa−1, which is promising for hydrogen separation and purification.},

The sensing properties of the optical fiber sensor to gaseous ammonia at room temperature were investigated. The sensing probe showed different fluorescence intensity at 576 nm to different concentrations of trace ammonia in carrier gas of nitrogen. The response range was 50-400 ppm, with short response time within 500 ms. Furthermore, the response range could be tailored through CTAB co-entrapment process in the sensing film.

The underlying gas sensing mechanism of the Pt-Co3O4/MoS2 sensor was systematically discussed, which demonstrates that the enhanced sensing performance of the sensor is attributed to the good synergistic effect of the ternary materials, including high availability of oxygen species, active catalytic effect, and special interactions at MoS2/Co3O4 heterojunction.},

abstract = {Palladium–silver alloy surfaces with and without adsorbed hydrogen have been studied through density functional theory within the generalized gradient approximations employing a slab representation of the surface. Our calculated lattice constants are in good agreement with experimental data, but we find a substantially lower surface energy for Ag?111? and Pd?111? than experiments. We have calculated adsorption energies of hydrogen on several sites on various alloy surfaces, and found that threefold hollow sites with as many palladium neighbors as possible are preferred. The difference in adsorption energy is so large that we expect trapping of hydrogen around palladium atoms in the surface, possibly resulting in a lower diffusion constant of hydrogen at low coverage on alloy surfaces than on the pure Pd and Ag surfaces. Assuming that the adsorption energy has contributions from geometric ?‘‘ensemble''? and electronic ?‘‘ligand''? effects, we found the geometric contribution to dominate. For the geometric contribution it is seen that the binding strength increases as the d-band center moves toward the Fermi level, a result also found by a number of other theoretical studies. However, for the electronic contribution we found that the variation of the adsorption energy as a function of the d-band center was opposite that reported by others:We saw that hydrogen binds less strongly to the surface as the d-band center moves toward the Fermi level. This could possibly be explained by a large variation of the interaction between the metal sp band and hydrogen.},

abstract = {Improvements in the efficiency of combustion within a vehicle can lead to reductions in the emission of harmful pollutants and increased fuel efficiency. Gas sensors have a role to play in this process, since they can provide real time feedback to vehicular fuel and emissions management systems as well as reducing the discrepancy between emissions observed in factory tests and ‘real world' scenarios. In this review we survey the current state-of-the-art in using porous materials for sensing the gases relevant to automotive emissions. Two broad classes of porous material – zeolites and metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) – are introduced, and their potential for gas sensing is discussed. The adsorptive, spectroscopic and electronic techniques for sensing gases using porous materials are summarised. Examples of the use of zeolites and MOFs in the sensing of water vapour, oxygen, NOx, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide, hydrocarbons and volatile organic compounds, ammonia, hydrogen sulfide, sulfur dioxide and hydrogen are then detailed. Both types of porous material (zeolites and MOFs) reveal great promise for the fabrication of sensors for exhaust gases and vapours due to high selectivity and sensitivity. The size and shape selectivity of the zeolite and MOF materials are controlled by variation of pore dimensions, chemical composition (hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity), crystal size and orientation, thus enabling detection and differentiation between different gases and vapours.},

abstract = {Currently, practically all industrial manufacturing of hydrogen is based on fossil fuels. However, even the “cleanest” of H2 production processes, steam methane reforming, produces close to 10kg CO2 per kilogram of H2 product. This fact may diminish the environmental appeal of hydrogen as an environmentally clean fuel. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop and implement fossil fuel-based hydrogen production processes with low-to-zero CO2 emissions. The objective of this chapter is to analyze existing and emerging technological options and solutions for eliminating or drastically reducing the amount of CO2 emissions from fossil fuel-based manufacturing of hydrogen. The main approaches to low-carbon production of hydrogen from fossil fuels discussed in this chapter include: (1) integration of fossil fuel-based hydrogen plants with CO2 capture and storage, (2) production of CO2-free hydrogen via dissociation of methane, and (3) the combination of fossil fuel-based hydrogen production processes with noncarbon energy sources such as nuclear and solar. Current status, emerging technological trends, and outlook for low-carbon production of hydrogen are analyzed in this chapter.},

This unique MOF-based sensor is made via the in situ growth of fumarate-based fcu-MOF (fum-fcu-MOF) thin film on a capacitive interdigitated electrode. The sensor showed a remarkable detection sensitivity for H2S at concentrations down to 100 ppb, with the lower detection limit around 5 ppb. The fum-fcu-MOF sensor exhibits a highly desirable detection selectivity towards H2S vs. CH4, NO2, H2, and C7H8 as well as an outstanding H2S sensing stability as compared to other reported MOFs.},

abstract = {A novel dye incorporated into microporous material is introduced for optical humidity sensing. Methylene blue (MB) was encapsulated into the protonated mordenite zeolite (HMOR) via ion exchange reaction. The dye molecules are strongly retained in the channels of the zeolite and take part in the protonation/deprotonation reactions reversibly. The mechanism of the sensor is based on the protonation or deprotonation of the dye molecules which are associated with the desorption or adsorption of water molecules by the zeolite, respectively. The spectral changes due to different humidity levels are probed by diffuse reflectance spectroscopy. Discs prepared from 200 mg of the dye-loaded zeolite provide a thickness of ???0.8 mm and show good characteristics for an optical humidity sensor. They showed a linear response range from 9 to 92{\%} relative humidity (r2 {\textgreater} 0.99), and good stability and reversibility. The sensor operates at either of the two 650 or 745 nm bands but it exhibits a higher sensitivity for the measurements performed at 650 nm. The sensor demonstrates relatively fast response and recovery times about 2 min in the direction of adsorption and about 4 min in the direction of desorption of water. ?? 2004 Elsevier B.V.

ZnO nano-crystallites serve the dual purpose of acting as a nano-spacer between dried graphene sheets as well as a primary sensing transducer for the gas sensing applications. PL has been used as a tool to study the defects associated with the surface of the nanocrystallite's trap levels and/or acceptor-donor recombinations. Time-resolved PL was used to determine free carrier or exciton lifetimes, a vital parameter related to quality of composite and device performance. Results are presented for the detection of common industrial toxins like CO, NH3 and NO for concentrations as low as 1 ppm at room temperature.

The sensor nanomaterials were prepared from SnO2 hollow spheres (synthesized by employing carbon microspheres as temples) and Cu precursor by dipping method. The composition and structural characteristics of the as-prepared CuO-doped SnO2 hollow spheres were studied by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, X-ray powder diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy. Gas-sensing properties of CuO-doped SnO2 hollow sphere were also investigated. It was found that the sensor showed good selectivity and high sensitivity to H2S gas. A ppb level detection limit was obtained with the sensor at the relatively low temperature of 35 A degrees C. Such good performances are probably attributed to the hollow sphere nanostructures. Our results imply that materials with hollow sphere nanostructures are promising candidates for high-performance gas sensors.},

abstract = {A high molecular weight polyimide (Matrimid) was used as a precursor for fabricating supported carbon molecular sieve membranes without crack formation at 550-700°C pyrolysis temperature. A one-step polymer (polyimide) coating method as precursor of carbon layer was used without needing a prior modification of a TiO2macroporous support. The following fabrication variables were optimized and studied to determine their effect on the carbon structure: polymeric solution concentration, solvent extraction, heating rate and pyrolysis temperature. Two techniques (Thermogravimetric analysis and Raman spectroscopy) were used to determine these effects on final carbon structure. Likewise, the effect of the support was also reported as an additional and important variable in the design of supported carbon membranes. Atomic force microscopy and differential scanning calorimetry quantified the degree of influence. Pure gas permeation tests were performed using CH4, CO, CO2and H2. The presence of a molecular sieving mechanism was confirmed after defects were plugged with PDMS solution at 12wt{\%}. Gas selectivities higher than Knudsen theoretical values were reached with membranes obtained over 650°C, showing as best values 4.46, 4.70 and 10.62 for H2/N2,H2/CO and H2/CH4ratio, respectively.

abstract = {A new AM-3 membrane was prepared on a stainless-steel support for potential application in the separation of light gases, particularly hydrogen containing mixtures. It was dynamically characterized by permeation assays using H2, He, N2, CO2, and O2at fixed and programmed temperatures (between 304 and 394 K), and transmembrane pressure drops from 0.5 to 1.5 bar. The experimental results disclosed high selectivity of the AM-3 membrane towards hydrogen. In terms of transport mechanisms, they evidenced an activated behavior typical of surface diffusion, and a small contribution of macro-defects. The existence of intercrystalline micro-defects was revealed by the permeation of N2, O2, and CO2, whose kinetic diameters are larger than the pore diameter of AM-3. Gas permeation was accurately modeled based on the Maxwell-Stefan approach for surface diffusion in micropores, with additional terms for Knudsen and viscous fluxes through meso- and macro-defects. The global deviation achieved for the five gases was only 3.42{\%}. The calculated results demonstrated that: viscous flow prevailed at low temperature (304 K), surface diffusion dominated when temperature increased, Knudsen transport was residual, the flux through defects predominated at 304 K (53.8–73.5{\%} of total flux) but fell below 15{\%} for temperatures above 370 K, and the influence of the support was negligible.},

The thin films are prepared by spin coating deposition of nanosized LTL and BEA type zeolites suspensions the palladium clusters are introduced in the nanosized zeolites by ion exchange followed by $\gamma$ radiolysis of the coating suspensions. The Pd-containing zeolite films with a thickness of 200 nm are exposed to a single gas (either CO or hydrocarbons) or gas mixtures in the presence of water (100 ppm), and the IR spectra are collected continuously at 25, 75, and 100 °C. The fast recognition of very low concentrations of CO (2-100 ppm) in the presence of highly concentrated vapors of methanol or pentane (400-4000 ppm) with the Pd-containing zeolite films is demonstrated. The detection of CO and hydrocarbons is instant, which is a function of the low thickness of the films, small size of the individual zeolite crystals, and regular size and high stability of the Pd clusters in the zeolite films. The heat of adsorption for all experiments is similar (15 kJ.mol(-1)), which is explained with weak interactions between the carbon monoxide and palladium clusters in the zeolite films at temperatures below 100 °C. The nanosized zeolites with homogeneously distributed Pd clusters deposited in thin films demonstrate high molecular recognition capacity toward low concentrations of carbon monoxide under real environmental conditions, i.e., in the presence of water and hydrocarbons.},

abstract = {A facile strategy for the layer-by-layer synthesis of sandwich-like zeolite LTA membranes by using 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES) as modifier is reported. APTES reacts with surface hydroxyls and forms a covalently bonded siloxane interlayer. APTES treatment is helpful to promote nucleation and growth of the zeolite LTA layer on solid surfaces. Further, the covalently bonded self-assembled siloxane film can protect the already formed LTA layer from dissolution and transformation during the next hydrothermal LTA synthesis step, thus facilitating the formation of well intergrown and phase-pure multi-layer zeolite LTA membranes. The multi-layer zeolite LTA membranes display molecular sieving performance, and each additional LTA layer improves the selectivity of the sandwich-like LTA layer stack. In mixed gas separation at 100°C, the mixture separation factors for equimolar mixtures of H2/CO2, H2/N2, H2/CH4and H2/C3H8, on the single/multi-layer LTA zeolite membranes in the Na+state are found to be 6.3, 5.6, 4.3 and 6.5 (single-layer), 8.8, 7.2, 5.8 and 12.6 (double-layer), and 12.5, 8.6, 6.5 and 19.3 (triple-layer). {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {To understand the relative importance of biological versus physicochemical control over biomineralization, we have tested if the chemical composition of the medium (i.e., the Mg/Ca ratio) can change the mineralogy of mollusk shells. The shells of mollusks are made of calcite and/or aragonite, which are by far the most common CaCO3 polymorphs. Several species of bivalves with predominantly calcitic shells have been cultivated in artificial seawater with a Mg/Ca molar ratio within the range of 8.3-9.2, well above the present value for seawater (5.2). Four out of six species used (the scallop Chlamys varia, the oyster Ostrea edulis, the saddle oyster Anomia ephippium and the mussel Mytilus edulis) survived long enough to secrete significant amounts of calcium carbonate. The deposits (sometimes extensive) formed on the interior shell surfaces were predominantly aragonitic. Three individuals of C. varia also increased their length by adding new shell at the margin. Contrary to the internal shell deposits, these margins were high-Mg calcite. This implies that the marginal mantle is able to exert a more strict control on the secreted mineral phase than the mantle facing the internal shell surface. This is the first report on an in vivo experimentally forced switch in bivalve shell mineralogy, from calcite to aragonite due to a change in water chemistry.},

The adhesion of the MOF layer to the ceramic support was investigated in different taxing conditions. Furthermore, by coating this UiO-66 membrane with a thin polyimide (Matrimid) top layer, we prepared a multilayer composite. Said membranes have been evaluated in the separation of hydrogen (H2) from different binary mixtures at room temperature. H2 as the smallest molecule (2.9 {\AA}) should pass the UiO-66 membrane preferably since the kinetic diameters of all the other gases under study are larger. The gas mixture separation factors for the neat UiO-66 membrane were indeed found to be H2/CO2 = 5.1, H2/N2 = 4.7, H2/CH4 = 12.9, H2/C2H6 = 22.4, and H2/C3H8 = 28.5.

The integrity of the La5.5WO11.25-$\delta$ after the hydrogen permeation experiments was confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Raman spectroscopy. The stability of La5.5WO11.25-$\delta$ permeation when CO2 containing atmosphere was used as sweep gas was evaluated.

The specification, which is referenced in a recent EU directive, sets maximum limits for 14 impurities in hydrogen. We consider one entry in the specification, total halogenated compounds, and conclude that no currently available analytical method is able to measure total halogenated compounds in a robust, traceable and accurately quantifiable manner. Three suggestions for addressing this problem when the standard is revised are given, namely (1) replacing `total halogenated compounds' with a list of key halogenated compounds that can be measured individually, (2) identifying compounds whose measurement is more routine to act as `canary species' for hydrogen produced from different sources and (3) setting different specifications for hydrogen produced from different sources. Prior to the revision of ISO 14687, we propose that inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy provides the best currently available analytical solution to estimate the amount fraction of halogenated compounds in hydrogen.},

Adsorption of the olefins resulted in a fluorescence enhancement, while the corresponding paraffins either did not change or partially quenched the fluorescence.

abstract = {We present a detailed investigation of the nucleation sites, growth, and morphology of large-area graphene samples synthesized via chemical vapor deposition (CVD) on bulk palladium substrates. The CVD chamber was systematically controlled over a large range of growth temperatures and durations, and the nature of graphene growth under these conditions was thoroughly investigated using a combination of scanning electron microscopy and a statistical analysis of {\textgreater}500 Raman spectra. Graphene growth was found to initiate at ?825 °C, above which the growth rate increased rapidly. At T = 1000 °C, defect-free high-quality graphene was found to grow at an unprecedented rate of tens of micrometers per second, orders of magnitude faster than past reports on Cu- or Ni-based growth, thus leading to macroscopic coverage of the substrate within seconds of growth initiation. By arresting the growth at lower temperatures, we found that graphene nanoislands preferred to nucleate at very specific positions close to terrace edges and step inner edges. Evidence of both epitaxial and self-limiting growth was found. Along with monolayer graphene, both Bernal and turbostratic multilayer graphene could be obtained. A detailed evolution of the different types of graphene, as a function of both growth temperature and duration, has been presented. From these, optimal growth conditions for any chosen type of graphene sample can be inferred.},

The MOF shows highly selective and fast response towards H2S even in presence of other relevant biomolecules. Low cytotoxicity and H2S detection in live cells, demonstrate the potential of MOF towards monitoring H2S chemistry in biological system.

abstract = {Co-doped BaCe0.85Tb0.05Co0.1O 3-?? (BCTCo) nanopowder was synthesized via a sol-gel method using ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and citric acid as the chelating agents. Using the resultant powder, BCTCo perovskite hollow fibre membranes were then fabricated by the combined phase inversion and sintering technique. Properties of the BCTCo powder and the hollow fibre membranes in terms of crystalline phase, morphology, electrical conductivity, porosity, mechanical strength and hydrogen/oxygen permeation were investigated by a variety of characterization methods. The results indicated that doping of cobalt in the BCTb oxide led to a higher electrical conductivity and lower calcination temperature for the powder precursor to a perovskite structure as well as sintering temperature for the hollow fibre precursors to gastight membranes. In order to obtain gastight and robust hollow fibre membranes, the sintering temperature should be controlled between 1300 and 1450 C. The maximum hydrogen flux through the BCTCo hollow fibre membranes reached up to 0.385 mL cm -2 min-1 at 1000 C under 50{\%} H2-He/N 2 gradient, which is higher than that of the un-doped BCTb hollow fibre membranes with the same effective thickness, and especially much higher than that obtained from other proton conductors due to the asymmetric structure of the membrane designed. Moreover, the BCTCo hollow fibre membrane also exhibited noticeable oxygen permeation fluxes, i.e. 0.122 mL cm-2 min-1 at 1000 C under the air/He gradient. However, doping of cobalt might damage the mechanical stability of the perovskite membranes in the hydrogen-containing atmosphere. ?? 2013, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

abstract = {Dihydro-1,2,4,5-tetrazine-3,6-dicarboxylate was introduced into the chemically stable UiO-66 structure by a postsynthetic linker exchange reaction to create an optical sensor material for the detection of oxidative agents such as nitrous gases. The incorpo-rated tetrazine unit can be reversibly oxidized and reduced, which is accompanied by a drastic colour change from yellow to pink and vice versa. The high stability of the framework during redox reaction was proven by powder X-ray diffraction and nitrogen physisorption measurements. Gas sensors are widely used for monitoring the concentration of different gases such as methane in coal mines or carbon monoxide for personal protection using portable devices. An ideal sensor should be sensitive and stable enough to operate under ambient conditions and additionally produce a signal with a short response time that is easy to sense without the need for further equipment, the so-called wireless gas sensor. 1 One of the simplest, and arguably most powerful, means of transducing a sensing signal is via a visible change in the color of the material. 2 Furthermore, a sensor needing no power to work is independent of the availability of power sources being operational anytime and anywhere. NO x (nitrous gases) is a generic term for nitric oxide (NO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO 2), which are poisonous gases often released into the atmosphere by motor vehicles and industrial and domestic combustion processes. Therefore detection and monitoring of nitrous gases is of great interest and many NO x gas sensors have been investigated, for example, metal oxide semiconductors, solid electrolytes, and conducting polymers such as polypyrrole and polyaniline. The modular design of metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) along with a high porosity (allowing a rapid accessibility for guest molecules) opens the way for the targeted synthesis of desired sensor materials.},

abstract = {An asymmetric carbon membrane was prepared by coating alcohol solution of novolac phenol-formaldehyde resin containing a little hexamine on a porous resin support from the same material. After drying in air for two days at room temperature, the coated support was heated at 150 °C for 1 h in air (heating rate: 0.5 °C/min) and then carbonized at 800 °C (heating rate: 0.5 °C/min) in Ar atmosphere. The support and the membrane layer were carbonized simultaneously. The coating-pyrolysis cycle only needed one time. SEM photographs showed the carbon membrane had an asymmetric structure formed by a dense skin layer with a thickness of around 35 $\mu$m and a porous substrate. Pure gases of different molecular size (H2, CO2, O2, N2and CH4) were used to test the carbon membrane permeance property. The membrane has a good selectivity for H2/N2and H2/CH4with H2permeance of 4.05 × 10-6cm3cm-2s-1cmHg-1. The permeance is independent of pressure. The results indicate that the gases transport through the membrane according to molecular sieve mechanism. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Spat from the ¢rst settlement group attained a larger size and weight than spat from larvae settled 3 days later, but had a lower daily growth rate ({\%}). Keeping the late-settled spat a longer time in the hatchery to reach a bigger size before transfer seemed not to improve subsequent nursery growth. Survival showed a large variation with mean survival ranging from 32{\%} to 74{\%}. A substantial reduction in lipid content was found after transfer to the nursery. Sterol content at transfer was the only lipid class correlating with survival in the nursery.

@article{Koenig2012,
abstract = {Membranes act as selective barriers and play an important role in processes such as cellular compartmentalization and industrial-scale chemical and gas purification. The ideal membrane should be as thin as possible to maximize flux, mechanically robust to prevent fracture, and have well-defined pore sizes to increase selectivity. Graphene is an excellent starting point for developing size-selective membranes because of its atomic thickness, high mechanical strength, relative inertness and impermeability to all standard gases. However, pores that can exclude larger molecules but allow smaller molecules to pass through would have to be introduced into the material. Here, we show that ultraviolet-induced oxidative etching can create pores in micrometre-sized graphene membranes, and the resulting membranes can be used as molecular sieves. A pressurized blister test and mechanical resonance are used to measure the transport of a range of gases (H(2), CO(2), Ar, N(2), CH(4) and SF(6)) through the pores. The experimentally measured leak rate, separation factors and Raman spectrum agree well with models based on effusion through a small number of angstrom-sized pores.},

Zeolite seeds with a mean size of 40 nm were obtained at room temperature and used to form precursor layers via several identical adsorption steps on silane-modified sensor surfaces. Oriented LTA-type films with thicknesses in the range of 65-980 nm were prepared after additional hydrothermal treatment of the precursor seed layers at elevated temperature (100 degreesC) for different crystallization times (from 3 to 24 h). The application of LTA-type zeolite films in humidity microsensors is presented. The importance of film thickness, type of zeolite structure, and the preparation parameters of the sensor layers with respect to the sensitivity of the humidity sensors at different water vapor concentrations are discussed. The zeolite films are hydrophilic and thermally stable and show reproducible response. On the basis of these results, it was concluded that the above LTA zeolite films can be used effectively as humidity sensor materials for water vapor sensing purposes. High sensitivity, good reversibility, and long life were demonstrated for thin LTA-type zeolite films at low water concentrations.},

M-MOF-74s are very interesting MOFs because they contain coordinatively unsaturated metal centers where adsorbates can interact strongly with their affinity towards gas molecules. Interaction of the CO2 molecules with open metal sites or amine-functional groups changes the work function (????) of sensing layer which can serve as a signal for gas sensors. Results show that ethylenediamine functionalized Mg-MOF-74 exhibited enhanced CO2 gas sensing properties compared to other M-MOF-74 with respect to sensitivity, reversibility and stability.},

Permeabilities of permanent gases in Teflon AF 2400 are among the highest of all known polymers; the oxygen permeability coefficient at 25°C is 1600 x 10-10cm3(STP) cm/cm2s cmHg and the nitrogen permeability coefficient is 780 x 10-10cm3(STP) cm/cm2s cmHg. The permeabilities of organic vapors increase up to 20-fold as the vapor activity increases from 0.1 to unity, indicating that Teflon AF 2400 is easily plasticized. Although Teflon AF 2400 is an ultrahigh-free-volume polymer like poly(1-trimethylsilyl-1-propyne) [PTMSP], their gas permeation properties differ significantly. Teflon AF 2400 shows gas transport behavior similar to that of conventional, low-free-volume glassy polymers.

abstract = {Graphene is a well-known two-dimensional material that exhibits preeminent electrical, mechanical and thermal properties owing to its unique one-atom-thick structure. Graphene and its derivatives (e.g., graphene oxide) have become emerging nano-building blocks for separation membranes featuring distinct laminar structures and tunable physicochemical properties. Extraordinary molecular separation properties for purifying water and gases have been demonstrated by graphene-based membranes, which have attracted a huge surge of interest during the past few years. This tutorial review aims to present the latest groundbreaking advances in both the theoretical and experimental chemical science and engineering of graphene-based membranes, including their design, fabrication and application. Special attention will be given to the progresses in processing graphene and its derivatives into separation membranes with three distinct forms: a porous graphene layer, assembled graphene laminates and graphene-based composites. Moreover, critical views on separation mechanisms within graphene-based membranes will be provided based on discussing the effect of inter-layer nanochannels, defects/pores and functional groups on molecular transport. Furthermore, the separation performance of graphene-based membranes applied in pressure filtration, pervaporation and gas separation will be summarized. This article is expected to provide a compact source of relevant and timely information and will be of great interest to all chemists, physicists, materials scientists, engineers and students entering or already working in the field of graphene-based membranes and functional films.},

abstract = {Samples of amorphous Fe 40 Ni 38 Mo 4 B 18 and Ni 81 P 19 alloys were submitted to electrochemical hydrogen permeation tests, under cathodic charging conditions, which resulted in elevated hydrogen fugacity. Two different permeation techniques were used: the double-potentiostatic and the potentiostatic step methods. The main difference between these techniques is the form of the resulting hydrogen concentration profile across the sample thickness. The hydrogen permeation curves for the Ni 81 P 19 samples, for both techniques, had shapes identical to the theoretical curves. The experimental curves for the Fe 40 Ni 38 Mo 4 B 18 samples, however, deviated from the theoretical curves. These deviations are attributed to the formation of a hydride phase due to the high hydrogen fugacity imposed during cathodic charging. The potential use of these electrochemical hydrogen permeation techniques is demonstrated in the study of phase separation through the analysis of the growth of a new phase. The diffusivity of hydrogen in the hydride formed in the Fe 40 Ni 38 Mo 4 B 18 amorphous metallic alloy was found to be 5.7 ± 0.3 × 10 -15 m 2 s -1 and the thickness of the hydride layer, formed during the double-potentiostatic test, for a cathodic charging level of -2000 mV/SCE saturated calomel electrode (SCE) was found to be 18.9 ± 0.5 $\mu$m. {\textcopyright} 1998 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

Graphene is a single-atom-thick sheet of sp2 hybridized carbon atoms that are packed in a hexagonal honeycomb crystalline structure. Graphene is the fundamental building block of all sp2 carbon materials including single-walled carbon nanotubes, mutliwalled carbon nanotubes, and graphite and is therefore interesting from the fundamental standpoint as well as for practical applications. One of the most promising applications of graphene that has emerged so far is its utilization as an ultrasensitive chemical or gas sensor. In this article, we review some of the significant work performed with graphene and its derivatives for gas detection and provide a perspective on the challenges that need to be overcome to enable commercially viable graphene chemical sensor technologies.},

In this paper, recent studies on appropriate approaches for the selective capture of harmful gases (NH3, CO, H2S, NOx, SOx, Cl2, etc.) performed via experimental and computational methods are comprehensively reviewed with the aim of establishing well-designed strategies for the specific tasks. Three primary conclusions regarding the design strategy of MOFs are highlighted from the reviewed studies: the introduction of appropriate open metal sites for the selective capture of polar harmful gases, inefficiency of open metal sites introduced for the selective capture of non-polar harmful gases, and introduction of appropriate surface functionality for individual harmful gas. It is believed that the review will play a critical role in designing promising MOFs with appropriate surface chemistry for the selective capture of harmful gases from air.},

Calculation also shows that hydrogen diffusion between surface layer and inter-site seems energetically more favorable than diffusion within the surface layer, and that the small energy barrier suggests the easy diffusion of hydrogen across the Pd3Ag/TiAl interface. Moreover, hydrogen diffusion would have a small effect to increase the interface energy and decrease the interface strength. The calculated results are in good agreement with experimental observations in the literature, and demonstrate that the Pd3Ag/TiAl membranes should be a good candidate for hydrogen permeation.},

The chemical and physical phenomena involved in the atomic diffusion during the thermal treatment as well as the crystalline structure were tracked by scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray analysis, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction. In order to isolate the main component of the hydrogen transport (solution-diffusion mechanism), the composite membranes were considered as layers in series, with porous and dense parts; the porous areas were modeled by the dusty gas model. This allowed a more accurate estimation of Sievert's transport parameters and a critical comparison with data reported in the literature. ?? 2010, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

abstract = {This review assesses technologies and catalysts pertaining to the catalytic decomposition of hydrocarbons for the CO2-free generation of hydrogen for fuel cell applications through a single-step cracking (decomposition, decarbonization, dehydrogenation, pyrolysis, splitting, or dissociation) of hydrocarbons. It discusses and systematically categorizes the options for hydrocarbon decomposition to hydrogen and carbon. This decomposition helps to reduce green house gases by co-producing valuable carbon products such as carbon black or graphite-like carbon (carbon nanotubes or carbon filaments). The catalytic approach comprises metal and carbon-based catalysts while plasma-based decomposition depends on thermal or non-thermal methods. Almost all the proposed processes are applicable to a variety of gaseous and liquid hydrocarbon fuels, and some of these processes can potentially produce a stream of high-purity hydrogen. There have been successful attempts to use catalysts to reduce the maximum temperature of the thermal decomposition of hydrocarbons. Common catalysts used are noble and transition metals such as Ni, Fe, Pd, Co, Mo, etc., supported on high surface area ceramic substrates such as A12O3 and SiO2, etc. Several other publications disclose the use of carbon-based materials as catalysts for decomposition of hydrocarbons into H2 and carbon. The other non-catalytic decomposition methods include non-thermal low-temperature plasmas such as RF (radio frequency), dc (direct current) generators, microwave plasmatrons, and arc plasma jet.},

abstract = {A seeding-free synthesis strategy was developed for the preparation of dense and phase-pure zeolite LTA membranes on 3-chloropropyltrimethoxysilane (CPTMS) functionalized supports. Through the functionalization of supports by using CPTMS, the nucleation and growth of a thin, well intergrown zeolite LTA membrane could be promoted on various porous supports such as Al2O3disks and tubes, and TiO2disks, as well as on dense supports such as stainless steel, PTFE, and glass disks. The SEM and XRD characterizations indicate that a relative thin but dense and phase-pure zeolite LTA membrane with a thickness of about 3.0$\mu$m can be formed on the porous Al2O3and TiO2disks by crystallization at 60°C for 24h, and no cracks, pinholes or other defects were observed in the membrane layer. The zeolite LTA membranes prepared on CPTMS-functionalized Al2O3disks were evaluated in single gas permeation and mixed gas separation. It is found that the zeolite LTA membranes prepared on CPTMS-modified Al2O3disks show molecular sieving in gas separation. For binary mixtures at 20°C and 1bar, the mixed gas separation factors of H2/CO2, H2/N2, H2/CH4, H2/C3H8and H2/C3H6, are found to be 7.4, 6.8, 5.2, 15.3 and 36.8, which are higher than the corresponding Knudsen coefficients. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Pd/alumina composite membranes were fabricated using the generally practiced electroless plating process involving two-step activation of a symmetric 0.2 m -alumina microfilter with tin (Sn) chloride sensitizer (containing SnCl2 and SnCl4) and palladium(II) chloride (PdCl2). Pd films were deposited on these activated supports with a hydrazine- (N2H4-) and PdCl2-containing electroless plating bath. When these membranes were tested at 823 K for several days, the ideal H2/N2 separation factor (pure gas permeability ratio) declined substantially, depending on the membrane thickness. Modifications to the activation procedure minimized the amount of Sn chloride used in the sensitizing step. This reduced the selectivity decline, although the problem was not eliminated. The amount of Sn present at the Pd/ceramic interface was qualitatively related to the high-temperature performance. Possible routes for pore formation and selectivity decline are suggested. Sn chloride was removed from the process entirely with a new activation technique utilizing palladium(II) acetate (Pd(O2CCH3)2). Prior to electroless plating, substrates were dip-coated in a chloroform solution of Pd acetate, dried, calcined, and then reduced in flowing H2. At 973 K, nitrogen flux through these membranes remained constant for a period of at least a week. However, hydrogen permeability decreased at 873 K and above because of annealing.},

abstract = {Pilot-scale zeolite NaA membranes with high PV performance supported on cheap coarse macroporous supports were prepared by one single secondary growth using varying temperature hot dip-coating seeding method (VTHD). Through the VTHD method, a thin, dense and pinhole-free asymmetric NaA seed layer composed of large and small NaA seeds could be manipulated onto the surface of a coarse macroporous support. The large NaA seeds mainly acted as fillers to reduce the pore sizes of the support while the small NaA seeds acted as nuclei to provide sites for NaA crystal growth. The effects of the seed suspension concentrations, the seed sizes and coating temperature on the morphology of the seed layer and the separation performance of the resulting NaA membranes were investigated. The reproducibility of the VTHD method was as high as 70{\%}. The zeolite NaA membrane prepared by the VTHD method showed a water flux of 2.85kgm-2h-1with a separation factor over 10,000 in dehydrating the 90wt{\%} ethanol/10wt{\%} water mixture at 343K. The use of a cheap macroporous support and the high reproducibility of the VTHD method provide the feasibility for large-scale commercial production of low cost zeolite NaA membranes, promoting the broad application of zeolite NaA membranes. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

Film morphology was varied and stabilized by annealing in the range 77–473 K. As deduced from WF changes during adsorption and TPD, unannealed films formed on glass at 77 K are highly porous. On the films at 77 K, H2O adsorbs molecularly and binds to the surface through the O-atom as suggested by the decrease in work function. Data can be rationalized assuming that during TPD, the adsorbed H2O molecules undergo decomposition. H2 never evolved from the films, not even at 473 K, suggesting that the observed H2O desorption peak at T{\textgreater}220 K should involve molecule rebuilding, as found in Pd single crystals.},

The methyl substituents restrict internal rotation around the bonds between the phenyl rings and the imide rings. The rigidity and nonplanar structure of the polymer chain, and the bulkiness of methyl groups make chain packing inefficient, resulting in increases in both diffusion and solubility coefficients of the gases. Polyimides from tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine and trimethyl-m-phenylenediamine display very high permeability coefficients and very low permselectivity due to very high diffusion coefficients and very low diffusivity selectivity, as compared with the other polyimides having a similar fraction of free space. This suggests that these polyimides have high fractions of large-size free spaces.},

The wettability and pore structure of the modified silica membranes were characterized by means of water contact angle measurement, Fourier translation infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), solid state29Si magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (29Si MAS NMR) and nitrogen adsorption. The membrane performances including gas permeation/separation and long-term hydrothermal stability were also investigated in detail. The results show that perfluorodecyl groups have been successfully incorporated, resulting in a transformation from hydrophility to hydrophobicity for the modified silica membranes. With a low PFDTES/TEOS molar ratio of 0.2, the modified silica membranes exhibit a water contact angle of 112.6±0.5° and a pore size ranging from 0.45 to 0.9nm. The hydrogen permeance increases with increasing temperatures, leading to a considerably high value of 9.71×10-7molm-2s-1Pa-1at 300°C. At such a temperature, the H2/CO2permselectivity and binary gas separation factor are 7.19 and 12.11, respectively. Under a humid condition with a temperature of 250°C and a water vapor molar ratio of 5{\%}, the single H2permeance and H2/CO2permselectivity remain almost constant for at least 200h, indicating that the modified membranes possess an outstanding hydrothermal stability. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

The room-temperature NH3 sensing properties of a sensor based on the Cu2O nanorods/rGO composites were systematically investigated. The sensor exhibited an excellent sensitivity and linear response toward NH3 at room temperature. Furthermore, the sensor could be easily recovered to its initial state in a short time after exposure to fresh air. The sensor also showed excellent repeatability and selectivity to NH3. The remarkably enhanced NH3-sensing performances could be attributed to the improved conductivity, catalytic activity for the oxygen reduction reaction and increased gas adsorption in the unique hybrid composites. Such composites showed great potential for manufacturing a new generation of low-power and portable ammonia sensors.},

abstract = {Hydrogen permeation performance of palladium membranes supported on porous alpha-alumina and yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) was studied at 300-850 degrees C. The hydrogen permeation flux across the palladium-alpha-alumina membrane decreased markedly during permeation tests conducted at {\textgreater}600 degrees C. The SEM and XPS studies of the post-test membrane revealed the presence of aluminium in the palladium layer. Such migration of aluminium was not observed by heating the palladium-alpha-alumina membrane under an argon atmosphere, indicating that hydrogen is responsible for this phenomenon. Hydrogen-induced strong metal-support interaction might be related to this considerable loss of the hydrogen flux. Reduction of alumina to Al(0) by active hydrogen at the membrane-support interface and subsequent migration of Al(0) into the palladium layer represents the most plausible mechanism for the aluminium diffusion. Actually, Al(0) that migrated into the palladium membrane layer generated less hydrogen-permeable palladium-aluminium alloy or inter-metallic compound phase. In contrast, no such strong interaction was found between the YSZ support and the palladium membrane. This composite membrane exhibited a steady permeation of hydrogen at 650 degrees C for 336 h. Having a remarkably high reduction potential, Y(III) is unlikely to be reduced to Y(0), although Zr(IV) has a comparable reduction potential to that of Al(III). A binary phase diagram shows a liquid alloy phase present for the Pd/Al couple at temperatures greater than 615 degrees C (eutectic point), while an inter-metallic compound or liquid alloy phase in the Pd-Zr binary system is not apparent at temperatures less than 750 degrees C. Consequently, inter-diffusion of zirconium with palladium did not occur during operations at 650 degrees C.},

abstract = {Self-supported Pd-Au membranes were produced by magnetron sputtering and cold working with compositions between 7 and 20wt{\%} Au. Permeation tests were performed in synthetic water-gas shift reaction mixtures with up to 50ppm H2S. Membranes with higher gold content showed less flux inhibition by either carbon or sulfur containing species, regardless of fabrication technique or thickness. A 20wt{\%} Au alloy had the same permeability in pure hydrogen as it did in a sulfur-free WGS mixture, and only lost 40{\%} of its permeability in a 20ppm H2S mixture. However, membranes produced by sputtering experienced irreversible loss of hydrogen selectivity when exposed to mixtures containing sulfur, caused by a significant decrease in membrane thickness. No equivalent decrease in thickness or selectivity was observed for cold-worked membranes. This metal loss is explained by a corrosive mechanism in which palladium sulfides flake off the feed surface and are entrained. Although sulfidation also occurs in cold-worked membranes only sputtered membranes display this corrosion, due to a different microstructure in which grains are oriented perpendicular to the surface. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The present work focuses on the synthesis and gas permeation properties of ceramic supported ultrathin palladium-silver alloy membranes. PdAg films with a thickness ranging from 250 to 500 nm are coated on the surface of 3 nm pore sol-gel derived $\gamma$-alumina support using an RF magnetron sputtering equipment. The coated PdAg membranes exhibit the same composition and phase structure as those of the PdAg foil used as the target in sputter deposition. The hydrogen to nitrogen separation factor of the ultrathin PdAg membrane is 5.7 at 250°C and increases with increasing temperature. Under proper preparation conditions, use of a pinhole-free $\gamma$-alumina support is the key to ensure the gas-tightness and high-selectivity of the coated PdAg membranes. A method is demonstrated for studying hydrogen permeation through ultrathin metallic films. Hydrogen permeation data at different hydrogen pressures and temperatures (100–250°C) are reported to examine the mechanism of hydrogen permeation through the ultrathin metallic membranes. The experimental results clearly indicate the dominant role of surface reactions for hydrogen permeation through ultrathin metallic films at low temperatures.},

abstract = {Atomic modeling was conducted to investigate the origin of S interactions with Pd alloy H selective membrane candidates selected from the Pd-Cu, Pd-Ag, and Pd-Au binary systems, as well as their constitutive metals. The electronic characteristics of these alloy/metal systems played a more predominant role in controlling S bonding behavior than surface site geometries. The electronic coupling of S p orbitals bonding with alloy/metal d-bands in the adsorbate/slab density of states split the lower energy p bonding state and the d-band center further apart with increasing S bonding strength. A universal linear correlation was established for increasing adsorption strength (decreasing adsorption enthalpy) of 0.25 monolayer S with the increasing density of states energy difference: [d-band center - S p bonding peak]. The S interactions predicted at higher coverage provided indications of alloy susceptibility to irreversible S corrosion. The reversible adsorption of 1.0 monolayer S was only the most stable configuration on the more open Pd0.5Cu0.5 Im3??m and P4mmm (110) surfaces. The most competitive configuration for the interaction of a full S monolayer with the Pd0.75Cu0.25 Pm3??m and Pd0.875Au0.125 Fm3??m surfaces was the partial desorption and coupling of S. Partial incorporation of S to form a mixed absorbed/adsorbed S monolayer was more favorable for the Pd Fm3??m (111) surface, and also on the Pd0.5Cu0.5 P4mmm (101) and Pd0.75Ag0.25 Pm3??m (111) surfaces when accompanied by Pd segregation. The combination of S incorporation and Pd segregation was interpreted to be the first step towards nucleation of irreversible Pd4S formation. ?? 2011 Susanne M. Opalka.},

abstract = {PdAgAu alloy films were prepared on porous stainless steel supports by sequential electroless deposition. Two specific compositions, Pd83Ag2Au15 and Pd74Ag14Au12, were studied for their sulfur tolerance. The alloys and a reference Pd foil were exposed to 1000H2S/H2 at 623 K for periods of 3 and 30 h. The microstructure, morphology and bulk composition of both non-exposed and H2S-exposed samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). XRD and SEM analysis revealed time-dependent growth of a bulk Pd4S phase on the Pd foil during H2S exposure. In contrast, the PdAgAu ternary alloys displayed the same FCC structure before and after H2S exposure. In agreement with the XRD and SEM results, sulfur was not detected in the bulk of either ternary alloy samples by EDS, even after 30 h of H2S exposure. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) depth profiles were acquired for both PdAgAu alloys after 3 and 30 h of exposure to characterize sulfur contamination near their surfaces. Very low S 2p and S 2s XPS signals were observed at the top-surfaces of the PdAgAu alloys, and those signals disappeared before the etch depth reached ∼10 nm, even for samples exposed to H2S for 30 h. The depth profile analyses also revealed silver and gold segregation to the surface of the alloys; preferential location of Au on the alloys surface may be related to their resistance to bulk sulfide formation. In preliminary tests, a PdAgAu alloy membrane displayed higher initial H2 permeability than a similarly prepared pure Pd sample and, consistent with resistance to bulk sulfide formation, lower permeability loss in H2S than pure Pd.},

Development of membranes with integrated performances of permeability, selectivity and stability in the presence of hot vapor, is one of the prerequisites for their successful implementation. Herein, we reported a novel microporous hybrid silica membrane, fabricated through sol-gel deposition of an ethylene-bridged silsesquioxane layer on a multilayer porous support, by adjusting the amount of niobium alkoxide precursor. When the Nb content was less than 50{\%} (in mole), both hybrid siliceous microporous networks and generated Lewis acid sites imparted very low CO2permeance to the membrane while retaining its comparatively high H2permeance. Dominant densification shall take effect when Nb content was higher than 50{\%}, which leads to both low H2permeance and H2/CO2permselectivity. Hybrid silica membranes with niobium loading amount of 17{\%} and 33{\%} respectively, showed excellent stabilities in the presence of 150kPa steam under 200°C, as evidenced by steady H2permeances and exceptionally high H2/CO2permselectivities ({\textgreater}700) during long-term stability test up to 300h, which demonstrating a promising CO2separation membrane. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

On the basis of these innovations, many applications that include the use of CNTs have been demonstrated. Transparent electrodes for organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), lithium-ion batteries, supercapacitors, and CNT-based electronic components such as field-effect transistors (FETs) have been demonstrated. Furthermore, CNTs have been employed in catalysis and sensing as well as filters and mechanical and biomedical applications. This review highlights illustrative examples from these areas to give an overview of applications of CNTs.},

abstract = {The complete primary structure of MSP-1, a major water-soluble glycoprotein in the foliated calcite shell layer of the scallop Patinopecten yessoensis, is reported. The full-length complementary DNA for MSP-1 isolated by polymerase chain reaction contained a sequence for a signal peptide of 20 amino acids followed by a polypeptide of 820 amino acids with calculated molecular mass of 74.5 kDa. The deduced amino acid sequence of MSP-1 includes a high proportion of Ser (32{\%}), Gly (25{\%}), and Asp (20{\%}), and the predicted isoelectric point is 3.2; in these respects, MSP-1 is a typical acidic glycoprotein of mineralized tissues. A repeated modular structure characterizes MSP-1, with a sequence unit between 158 and 177 amino acids in length being repeated 4 times in tandem in the middle part of the protein. The repeated unit comprises 3 modules (SG, D, and K domains), each having a distinct amino acid composition and sequence. The SG domain is almost exclusively composed of Ser and Gly residues. The D domain is rich in Asp residues, potential N-glycosylation and phosphorylation sites. The K domain is rich in Gly residues and has a core of basic residues. The Asp residues are arranged more or less regularly in the D domains, exhibiting some repeated motifs such as Asp-Gly-Ser-Asp and Asp-Ser-Asp. Further, the 4 D domains indicate remarkable overall sequence similarities to each other. These observations suggest that the regular arrangements of COO(-) groups in the D domain side chains may be important for specific control of crystal growth.},

In this contribution, we demonstrate for the first time that metal-organic framework (MOF) can be grown on the covalent-organic framework (COF) membrane to fabricate COF-MOF composite membranes. The resultant COF-MOF composite membranes demonstrate higher separation selectivity of H2/CO2 gas mixtures than the individual COF and MOF membranes. A sound proof for the synergy between two porous materials is the fact that the COF-MOF composite membranes surpass the Robeson upper bound of polymer membranes for mixture separation of H2/CO2 gas pair and among the best gas-separation MOF membranes reported thus far.},

abstract = {This work highlights new research into the fundamental properties of palladium-gold alloy membranes. Two types of self-supported palladium-gold foils were studied; membranes produced by magnetron sputtering and membranes produced by cold-working. The cold-worked membranes had thicknesses of 25 microns and gold contents from 0-40 wt{\%} Au, while the sputtered films ranged from 10-31 microns in thickness and 5-10 wt{\%} Au. These films were characterized by single-gas permeation testing in the temperature range of 473-773K and at pressures of up to 772 kPa. Membranes were studied before and after testing by XRD, XPS, XRF, and SEM/EDS. Hydrogen permeability in the 0-20 wt Au{\%} range was found to be a function of synthesis technique as much as alloy content, with no single alloy having superior permeability at all temperatures. Sputtered materials had generally higher permeability than cold-worked materials of equivalent composition, although the thicker sputtered membrane had reduced hydrogen permeability compared to its thinner counterparts. In this composition range, the addition of gold generally acted to reduce activation energy of hydrogen permeation. The differences in membrane permeability by fabrication technique are primarily attributed to preferential orientation effects. These effects also appear to contribute to other permeation phenomena, such as low-temperature hydrogen embrittlement, the dependence of flux on feed pressure, and the formation of long range ordered surface phases},

A very large number of environmental burdens result from the operation of the different hydrogen production routes. A complete and accurate identification and quantification of the environmental emissions has been attempted. The use of wind, hydropower and solar thermal energy for the production of hydrogen are the most environmental benign methods.

abstract = {In the present work, we report a new road to enhance the gas separation performances of the zeolite Na-LTA membrane by tuning the pore size of zeolite LTA through silver cation exchange. Through the functionalization of the alumina support by using 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES), a thin, phase-pure and well intergrown zeolite Na-LTA membrane with a thickness of about 5.0 $\mu$m can be facilely prepared on the APTES-modified macroporous $\alpha$-Al2O3tube. After a following silver exchange treatment of the as-synthesized zeolite Na-LTA membranes, the sodium ions in zeolite Na-LTA framework are replaced by silver ions, thus forming zeolite Ag-LTA membranes with a narrower pore diameter. The zeolite Ag-LTA membranes were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). It is found that both the morphology and structure of the zeolite Na-LTA membrane keep unchanged after silver-exchange, and no cracks, pinholes or other defects are observed in the membrane layer. The zeolite Ag-LTA membrane shows high hydrogen selectivity due to the reduction of pore size of the zeolite Ag-LTA. For the separation of the binary mixture at 50 °C and 2.0 bar, the separation factor of H2/C3H8is $\alpha$≈120.8, which by far exceeds $\alpha$≈19.4 of the starting Na-LTA membrane, and are also much higher than the separation factors previously reported for the H2/C3H8mixture on zeolite membranes.},

abstract = {Two types of metal-organic framework (MOF)/ graphite oxide hybrid materials were prepared. One is based on a zinc-containing, MOF-5 and the other on a copper- containing HKUST-1. The materials are characterized by X-ray diffraction, sorption of nitrogen, thermal analyses, Fourier Transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and scan- ning electron microscopy (SEM). Their features are com- pared to the ones of the parent materials. The water stabil- ity and ammonia adsorption capacity of the hybrid materi- als were also evaluated. It was found that the latter com- pounds exhibit features similar to the ones of the parent MOF. In most cases, their porosity increased compared to the one calculated considering the physical mixture ofMOF and GO. This new porosity likely located between the two components of the hybrid materials is responsible for the enhanced ammonia adsorption capacity of the compounds. However, for both the zinc-based and the copper-based ma- terials (MOFs and hybrid materials), a collapse of the frame- work was observed as a result of ammonia adsorption. This collapse is caused by the interactions of ammonia with the metallic centers ofMOFs either by hydrogen bonding (zinc- based materials) or coordination and subsequent complex- ation (copper-based materials). Whereas the MOF-5 based compounds collapse in presence of humidity, the copper- based materials are stable.},

Their gas separation properties were measured and analyzed by correlation with macromolecular packing density. Polybenzoxazinoneimide membranes were prepared by heating prepolymer membranes to 220 °C. Difference between gas separation properties of membranes based on polybenzoxazinoneimides and those of their prepolymers was estimated. Gas transport properties of all novel membranes were compared with those of known membranes by using Robeson's diagram. It was established that a polybenzoxazinoneimide membrane including a polymer-metal complex is the most effective among membranes studied here. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Integrating water electrolysis and CO2 methanation is a highly effective way to store energy produced by renewables sources. The conversion of electricity into methane takes place via two steps: hydrogen is produced by electrolysis and converted to methane by CO2 methanation. The effectiveness and efficiency of power-to-gas plants strongly depend on the CO2 methanation process. For this reason, research on CO2 methanation has intensified over the last 10 years. The rise of active, selective, and stable catalysts is the core of the CO2 methanation process. Novel, heterogeneous catalysts have been tested and tuned such that the CO2 methanation process increases their productivity. The present work aims to give a critical overview of CO2 methanation catalyst production and research carried out in the last 50 years. The fundamentals of reaction mechanism, catalyst deactivation, and catalyst promoters, as well as a discussion of current and future developments in CO2 methanation, are also included.},

abstract = {A thermosetting phenolic resin with a pendant sulfonic acid group was prepared by reacting a resol-type phenolic resin (PF) with a Novalak-type sulfonated phenolic resin (SPF). Large amounts of gaseous molecules with similar and small size such as H2O and SO2 evolved in the range of 110 and 350 oC during the pyrolysis of this thermosetting phenolic resin (PF/SPF). Highly permeable carbon molecular sieve (CMS) membranes were obtained by pyrolysis of PF/SPF(45/55) precursor membranes which were dip-coated on porous alumina tubes. For example, the membrane pyrolyzed at 500 oC for 1.5 h displayed H2, CO2, and O2 permeances of 1950, 800, and 240 [GPU (gas permeation units) = 10-6 cm3(STP).s-1.cm-2.cmHg-1], respectively, and ideal H2/CH4, CO2/CH4, and O2/N2 separation factors of 65, 27, and 5.2 at 35 oC and 1 atm, respectively. Sulfonic acid groups linked to thermostable polymer chains might act as bonded templates and showed attractive potential in the preparation of CMS membranes.},

abstract = {Palladium membranes are of technological interest since they show a very high selectivity for hydrogen. Diffusion through the palladium is often the rate-limiting step in hydrogen transport through the membrane. Hydrogen flux can be improved by reducing the membrane thickness and increasing the hydrogen diffusivity. Nanostructured palladium has a higher hydrogen diffusivity than conventional palladium due to its large volume fraction of grain boundaries. They were generated as ultrathin membranes by d.c. magnetron sputtering onto porous Vycor?? glass substrates in an argon atmosphere. The nanostructured films exhibited no cracks on the submicron scale when examined with environmental scanning electron microscopy. The membranes delaminated from the substrates when exposed to hydrogen at room temperature, owing to the ?? ??? ?? phase transition. Heating the ultrathin nanostructured palladium membranes to 200 ??C led to some grain growth. Stabilization against the phase transition and grain coarsening is critical to applications of nanostructured membranes in hydrogen separations, and can be achieved by the alloying of palladium with another metal. ?? 1995.},

abstract = {Zeolite membranes possess a highly defined microporous structure which is capable of very unique separation principally based around molecular size exclusion, adsorption, and diffusion. Polycrystalline membranes of different zeolites have been prepared in the laboratory. These zeolite membranes show excellent separation performance for mixture with a strongly adsorbing component. These unique properties have let to industrial application of zeolite membranes for pervaporation separation of liquid mixtures. However, zeolite membranes exhibit somewhat lower diffusion-controlled selectivity for gas mixtures or unstable separation characteristics due to adsorption induced microstructural changes. These problems together with high membrane costs have hindered industrial applications of zeolite membranes for gas separations. Recent research has been directed toward synthesis of zeolite membranes by more efficient methods or on more cost-effective supports and microstructural engineering of the zeolite membranes. These efforts include understanding the formation of the non-zeolitic pores, developing methods to seal these defects, and synthesis of thin oriented zeolite membranes for improving separation performance. Research was also conducted to extend applications of zeolite membranes from gas and liquid separation to nanofiltration or desalination. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Composites of the metal-organic framework (MOF), MOF-5, and graphite oxide (GO) with different ratios of the two components are prepared and tested in ammonia removal under dry conditions. The parent and composite materials are characterized before and after exposure to ammonia by sorption of N(2), X-ray diffraction, thermal analyses, and FT-IR spectroscopy. The results show a synergetic effect resulting in an increase in the ammonia uptake compared to the parent materials. It is linked to enhanced dispersive forces in the pore space of the composites. Additionally, ammonia interacts with zinc oxide tetrahedra via hydrogen bonding and is intercalated between the layers of GO. Retention of a large quantity of ammonia eventually leads to a collapse of the MOF-5 structure in the composites. The effect resembles that observed when MOF-5 is exposed to water. Taking into account the similarity of ammonia and water molecules, it is hypothesized that ammonia causes a destruction of the MOF-5 and composite structure as a result of its hydrogen bonding with the zinc oxide clusters.},

The operating temperature and pressure ranges, used for studying the performance of these two kinds of membranes, are 350-450 degrees C and 200-800 kPa, respectively. The H2 permeances and the H2/N2 selectivities of both membranes were investigated and compared with literature data. At 400 degrees C and 200 kPa as pressure difference, Pd/PSS and Pd/Al2O3 membranes exhibited an H2/N2 ideal selectivity equal to 11700 and 6200, respectively, showing stability for 600 h. Thereafter, H2/N2 selectivity of both membranes progressively decreased and after around 2000 h, dropped dramatically to 55 and 310 for the Pd/PSS and Pd/Al2O3 membranes, respectively. As evidenced by Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) analyses, the pinholes appear on the whole surface of the Pd/PSS membrane and this is probably due to release of sulphur from the graphite seal rings.},

This new pore plating method basically consists on feeding both plating solution and reducing agent from opposite sides of support, allowing the preparation of totally hydrogen selective membranes with a significantly lower Pd consumption than the corresponding to the conventional electroless plating procedure. In the latter, both reducing agent and plating solution are added simultaneously in one side of the PSS support. This new plating method has been applied over raw commercial PSS supports and air calcined supports in order to generate a Fe-Cr oxide intermediate layer. A completely dense Pd membrane with a thickness in the range 11-20 ??m directly over tubular porous stainless steel tubes with a high roughness has been achieved. The permeation properties of the membranes have been tested at different operating conditions for pure feed gases: retentate pressure (1-4 bar) and temperature (350-450 ??C). All membranes present good permeance reproducibility after several thermal cycles and a complete hydrogen ideal selectivity, since complete retention of nitrogen is maintained for all tested experiment conditions, ensuring 100{\%} purity in the hydrogen permeate flux.

Sixty six individuals were exposed for 16 days to two successive dissolved Ba and Mo concentrations accurately differentiated by two different isotopic enrichments ( 97Mo, 95Mo; 135Ba, 137Ba). Soft tissue and shell isotopic composition were determined respectively by quantitative ICP-MS (Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometer) and laser ablation - ICP-MS. Results from Ba enrichment indicate the direct incorporation of dissolved Ba into the shell in proportion to the levels in the water in which they grew with a 6-8 day delay. The low spike contributions and the low partition coefficient (D Mo = 0.0049 ± 0.0013), show that neither the soft tissue nor the shell were significantly sensitive to Mo enrichment. These results eliminate direct Mo shell enrichment by the dissolved phase, and favour a trophic uptake that will be investigated using the successive isotopic enrichment approach developed in this study. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {We prepared the melt-spun (Ni0.6Nb0.4)100−xZrx (x=0 to 40 at{\%}) and other amorphous alloy membranes and examined the permeation of hydrogen through those alloy membranes. The interatomic spacing in the Ni–Nb–Zr amorphous structure increased with increasing Zr content. The crystallization temperature of the Ni–Nb–Zr amorphous alloys decreased with increasing Zr content. The hydrogen flow increased with an increase of the temperature or the difference in the square-roots of hydrogen pressures across the membrane, $\Delta$$\backslash$$\backslash$sqrtp. At relatively higher temperature up to 673 K or at relatively higher hydrogen pressure difference, $\Delta$$\backslash$$\backslash$sqrtp up to 550 Pa1⁄2, the hydrogen flow was more strictly proportional to $\Delta$$\backslash$$\backslash$sqrtp. This indicates that the diffusion of hydrogen through the membrane is a rate-controlling factor for hydrogen permeation. The permeability of the Ni–Nb–Zr amorphous alloys was strongly dependent on alloy compositions and increased with increasing Zr content. However, it was difficult to investigate the hydrogen permeability of the (Ni0.6Nb0.4)60Zr40 amorphous alloy in this work due to the embrittlement during the measurement. The maximum hydrogen permeability was 1.3×10−8 (mol{\textperiodcentered}m−1{\textperiodcentered}s−1{\textperiodcentered}Pa−1⁄2) at 673 K for the (Ni0.6Nb0.4)70Zr30 amorphous alloy. It is noticed that the hydrogen permeability of the (Ni0.6Nb0.4)70Zr30 amorphous alloy is higher than that of pure Pd metal. These permeation characteristics indicate the possibility of future practical use of the melt-spun amorphous alloys as a hydrogen permeable membrane.},

abstract = {Hydrogen permeation in 30{\%} Mo-substituted lanthanum tungsten oxide membranes, La27Mo1.5W3.5O55.5 (LWMo), has been measured as a function of temperature, hydrogen partial pressure gradient, and water vapor pressure in the sweep gas. Transport of hydrogen by means of ambipolar proton-electron conductivity and - with wet sweep gas - water splitting contributes to the measured hydrogen content in the permeate. At 700°C under dry sweep conditions, the H2 permeability in LWMo was 6 × 10 -4mLmin-1cm-1, which is significantly higher than that for state-of-the-art SrCeO3-based membranes. Proton conductivity was identified as rate limiting for ambipolar bulk transport across the membrane. On these bases it is evident that Mo-substitution is a successful doping strategy to increase the n-type conductivity and H2 permeability compared to nominally unsubstituted lanthanum tungsten oxide. A steady-state model based on the Wagner transport theory with partial conductivities as input parameters predicted H2 permeabilities in good agreement with the measured data. LWMo is a highly competitive mixed proton-electron conducting oxide for hydrogen transport membrane applications provided that long term stability can be ensured. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Despite much progress in the development of zeolite molecular sieve membranes, there is so far no industrial gas separation by zeolite membranes, with the exception of the de-watering of bio-ethanol by steam permeation using LTA membranes. During the last 5 years, metal-organic framework (MOF) membranes have been developed and tested in gas separation. The complete tool box of techniques originally developed for the preparation of zeolite membranes could be applied for the preparation of MOF membranes, such as the use of macroporous ceramic or metal supports, seeding, intergrowth-supporting additives, and microwave heating. There are some structure-related properties of MOFs which recommend them as suitable material for molecular sieve membranes. On the other hand, the structural flexibility of MOFs apparently prevents a sharp molecular sieving with a pore size estimated from the 'rigid' crystallographic structure by size exclusion. An application of MOFs is predicted in so-called mixed matrix membranes which show improved performance in comparison with the pure polymer membranes. Different from zeolites as organic-inorganic material, the MOF nanoparticles can be easily embedded into organic polymers, and standard shaping technologies to hollow fibers or spiral wound geometries can be applied. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Some compositions of ceramic hydrogen permeable membranes are promising for integration in high temperature processes such as steam methane reforming due to their high chemical stability in large chemical gradients and CO2 containing atmospheres. In the present work, we investigate the hydrogen permeability of densely sintered ceramic composites (cercer) of two mixed ionic-electronic conductors: La27W3.5Mo1.5O55.5-delta (LWM) containing 30, 40 and 50wtpercent La0.87Sr0.13CrO3-delta (LSC). Hydrogen permeation was characterized as a function of temperature, feed side hydrogen partial pressure (0.1-0.9bar) with wet and dry sweep gas. In order to assess potentially limiting surface kinetics, measurements were also carried out after applying a catalytic Pt-coating to the feed and sweep side surfaces. The apparent hydrogen permeability, with contribution from both H2 permeation and water splitting on the sweep side, was highest for LWM70-LSC30 with both wet and dry sweep gas. The Pt-coating further enhances the apparent H2 permeability, particularly at lower temperatures. The apparent H2 permeability at 700?C in wet 50percent H2 was 1.1?10-3mLmin-1cm-1 with wet sweep gas, which is higher than for the pure LWM material. The present work demonstrates that designing dual-phase ceramic composites of mixed ionic-electronic conductors is a promising strategy for enhancing the ambipolar conductivity and gas permeability of dense ceramic membranes. ?H2 flux of ceramic composites of mixed ionic-electronic conductors measured.?La27W5O55.5-LaCrO3 composites are chemically compatible and stable.?H2 permeability found to be among state-of-the-art dense ceramic membranes.?H2 permeability significantly higher than the individual composite components.},

abstract = {Gas transport through intrinsic defects and tears is a critical yet poorly understood phenomenon in graphene membranes for gas separation. We report that independent stacking of graphene layers on a porous support exponentially decreases flow through defects. On the basis of experimental results, we develop a gas transport model that elucidates the separate contributions of tears and intrinsic defects on gas leakage through these membranes. The model shows that the pore size of the porous support and its permeance critically affect the separation behavior, and reveals the parameter space where gas separation can be achieved regardless of the presence of nonselective defects, even for single-layer membranes. The results provide a framework for understanding gas transport in graphene membranes and guide the design of practical, selectively permeable graphene membranes for gas separation.},

abstract = {The hydrogen economy is fast approaching as petroleum reserves are rapidly consumed. The fuel cell promises to deliver clean and efficient power by combining hydrogen and oxygen in a simple electrochemical device that directly converts chemical energy to electrical energy. Hydrogen, the most plentiful element available, can be extracted from water by electrolysis. One can imagine capturing energy from the sun and wind and/or from the depths of the earth to provide the necessary power for electrolysis. Alternative energy sources such as these are the promise for the future, but for now they are not feasible for power needs across the globe. A transitional solution is required to convert certain hydrocarbon fuels to hydrogen. These fuels must be available through existing infrastructures such as the natural gas pipeline. The present review discusses the catalyst and adsorbent technologies under development for the extraction of hydrogen from natural gas to meet the requirements for the proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell. The primary market is for residential applications, where pipeline natural gas will be the source of H2 used to power the home. Other applications including the reforming of methanol for portable power applications such as laptop computers, cellular phones, and personnel digital equipment are also discussed. Processing natural gas containing sulfur requires many materials, for example, adsorbents for desulfurization, and heterogeneous catalysts for reforming (either autothermal or steam reforming) water gas shift, preferential oxidation of CO, and anode tail gas combustion. All these technologies are discussed for natural gas and to a limited extent for reforming methanol.},

At the Rh surface the hcp site of the threefold-coordinated adsorption sites is preferred, while at Pd almost no difference between the hcp and fee sites was found. For Pd, the occupation of subsurface positions was calculated to be more stable than bulklike positions. The energy gain caused by hydrogen absorption in subsurface positions is only about 100 meV lower than for hydrogen adsorption at the surface. In contrast, for Rh, significant differences between adsorption and absorption were calculated. The diffusion barrier for hydrogen diffusion from surface to subsurface positions was calculated and compared to the diffusion barrier in bulk. The hydrogen-induced work-function changes for the considered 4d transition-metal surfaces were positive for coverage theta=1.},

Heavy atoms, i.e. lead(ii) atoms, were introduced to the frameworks and coordinated with the chromophore to promote an efficient intersystem crossing from the singlet to the triplet 3MLCT excited state and further promote sensitivity to oxygen. The emissions of 1[middle dot]DMF, 1[middle dot]Acetone, 2[middle dot]Acetone and 3[middle dot]DMF (referred to hereafter as 1[middle dot]DMF-3[middle dot]DMF) were ascribed to metal-to-ligand charge transfer transitions (MLCTs). These four compounds, using phosphorescence based detection, were able to detect oxygen sensitively in real gas, and their noteworthy oxygen-sensing properties were also evaluated. The quenching constants, or KSV values, between 1[middle dot]DMF-3[middle dot]DMF and oxygen, can be deduced to be 1.44, 1.60, 2.85, and 5.11, respectively. The minimum detectable concentrations (LODs) of oxygen for 1[middle dot]DMF-3[middle dot]DMF were calculated to be 0.65{\%}, 0.70{\%}, 0.61{\%}, and 0.52{\%}, respectively, from three times the signal to noise ratio. Moreover, taking 3[middle dot]DMF as an example, short response (50 s) and recovery times (24 s) toward oxygen have been measured. It should be noted that the evaluated recovery time for 3[middle dot]DMF is even shorter than those reported for rare-earth MOF films. The gas sensing properties, including sensitivity, sensing linearity, reproducibility, matrix effect, cross-sensitivity effect, temperature effect, and long-term stability, were investigated. Finally, in order to spark a broad spectrum of interest in terms of an application, 3[middle dot]DMF was mixed with a commercial dye, Coumarin 480 (C480), to form a ratiometric oxygen sensor for the analysis of real gas in air.},

In the resulting membrane straight channels are uniformly vertically aligned and the membrane has a thickness of 0.5 $\mu$m.

The XRD analysis indicated that initially the nucleation of the two phases of the alloy (FCC and BCC) takes place, but the FCC/BCC ratio increases with the annealing time at 500 ??C in H2 stream. After 162 h, the film contained only the FCC phase, which presents promising properties to be applied in the synthesis of hydrogen selective membranes. SEM cross-section results showed that a dense, continuous, defect-free film was deposited on top of the SS support, and the EDS data indicated that no significant gradient was present on the thickness of the film. XPS and LEIS allowed us to determine that Cu and Ag surface segregation takes place after annealing up to 500 ??C/5 days. In the top-most surface layer, Ag enrichment takes place as determined by ARXPS experiments which can be the result of the lower surface tension of Ag compared to that of Cu and Pd. Increasing the annealing temperature results in an increase of the Ag surface segregation while the Cu concentration in the top-most surface layer decreases. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {H2production from a biomass fermentation process provides a great opportunity for green and sustainability economy compared to use fossil fuels (e.g., steam methane reforming process), but the process usually produces a humidified gas containing 35–65 (vol.{\%}) H2and 40–50 (vol.{\%}) CO2. A novel, energy efficient two-stage carbon membrane system for H2purification based on the combination of H2selective carbon molecular sieve membranes in the first stage and CO2selective carbon membranes in the second stage was proposed. The concept is the first unique technology providing a low H2purification cost {\textless}1 {\$}/kg H2produced at a feed pressure of 20 bara based on process simulation and cost estimation. The produced high purity CO2({\textgreater}95 vol.{\%}) and H2({\textgreater}99.5 vol.{\%}) can be integrated into a gasification reformer and Fischer-Tropsch reactors to improve the biodiesel productivity from biomass.},

abstract = {The present work was focused on the preparation of palladium alloy membranes and the effect of properties of ceramic support on the composited membrane morphology. Palladium-base membrane is known to have high selectivity and stability for hydrogen separation. In order to increase hydrogen permeation and separation factor, the membrane must be thinner and defect-free. Palladium membrane supported on a porous alumina prepared by electroless plating is the promising method to provide good hydrogen permeability. The alumina tube substrate was pre-seeded by immersing in the palladium acetate solution and followed by reduction in the alkaline hydrazine solution. After that, the deposition of palladium membrane could be achieved from the plating bath containing ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) stabilized palladium complex and hydrazine. The morphology of palladium film was observed to progress as a function of plating time and a dense layer membrane was available after plating for 3 h. The porosity of ceramic support exhibited an effect on the microstructure of deposited film such that the support with low porosity tended to achieve a defect free palladium membrane. ?? 2010 The Chinese Society for Metals.},

With this comprehensive study, we are able to clarify and correlate the underlying mechanisms regulating these responses with changes of physical and chemical environments. Our findings suggest that metal–organic framework materials in general, and MOF-74-Zn in particular, can be very promising materials for novel transducers and sensor applications, including highly selective small-molecule detection in gas mixtures.},

abstract = {Through a spin-coating technique, a high performance carbon molecular sieve (CMS) membranes were fabricated from thermally stable polymer polyphenylene oxide (PPO) and thermally labile polymer poly vinylpyrrolidone (PVP). The permeation results show that the small gas molecules (H2, CO2, N2, and CH4) transport mechanism is dominated by the molecular sieving effect. The permeation performances have a strong dependency upon polymer concentration and pyrolysis temperature. The best performance for hydrogen permeability obtained with PPO 15 PVP pyrolyzed at 700°C was 1121 Barrer (1 Barrer=1×10-10cm3(STP) cm/[cm2scm Hg]) and the values of selectivity for gas pairs such as H2/N2and H2/CH4were 163.9 and 160.9, respectively. The correlation factor of permselectivity of H2/N2and H2/CH4gas pairs obtained from PPO and PPO/PVP derived CMS membranes were above the Robeson (2008) upper bound. The addition of thermally labile PVP creates diffusion pathways and controls selectivities for the CMS membranes derived from PPO 10 PVP and PPO 15 PVP. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

Unlike the conventional strategies, in this procedure graphene oxide was reduced to GN by an endogenous reducing agent produced by DMF, which was used as solvent in the synthesis of Cu-MOF.  The nanocomposite exhibited high stability due to the hydrogen bonding, $\pi$-$\pi$ stacking and Cu-O coordination between Cu-MOF and GN.  Owing to the synergetic effect of Cu-MOF and GN, the Cu-MOF-GN nanocomposite showed high electrocatalytic activity.  When it was used for constructing H2O2 and ascorbic acid sensors, it presented good performance.  Thus, the Cu-MOF-GN nanocomposite has potential applications in the electrochem. field.

Without any sample treatment, the compositional distribution of the shell was obtained using LIBS for the element detection and Raman for the molecule recognition respectively. The elements Ca, K, Li, Mg, Mn and Sr were recognized by LIBS; the molecule carotene and carbonate were identified with Raman. It was found that the LIBS detection result was more related to the shell growth than the detection result of Raman. The obtained result suggested the shell growth might be developing in both horizontal and vertical directions.

Although CNTs have excellent separation properties, preparation of CNT-MMMs is more complicated. To employ CNTs as effective reinforcement in the polymeric matrix, proper dispersion and suitable interfacial adhesion between the CNTs and the polymer matrix have to be guaranteed.

abstract = {The surface segregation in Pd based alloys has been investigated by density-functional band-structure calculations. Twelve different metals were substituted in Pd(1 1 1) slabs at a level of 5{\%}: Ag, Au, Cd, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb, Pt, Rh, Ru, and Sn. The segregation energy (the difference in calculated total free energy between surface sites and bulk-like sites) was calculated for each alloy, and the results were in very good agreement with experimental data where available. Particularly, we predict an oscillatory depth profile for Cu and Ni, similar to what has been found experimentally for the PdNi(1 0 0) surface. There are more or less pronounced correlations between the segregation energy and the relaxed position at the surface of the substituted atom, the metal radius of the substituted atom, and the experimental surface energy of the metal. It is proposed that the segregation energy is an indirect measure of the stability of Pd based hydrogen permeable membranes. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Both MA and HCl doped polyanilines respond with comparable magnitudes towards CO; the latter responses are slightly smaller for the same doping level. Addition of zeolite 4A reduces the electrical conductivity response but improves the sensitivity towards CO with increasing zeolite concentration up to 40{\%} w/w. This concentration is evidently below the percolation threshold value, which is estimated to be above 50{\%} w/w. Composite with zeolite 3A has a comparable sensitivity value relative to that of pure polyaniline. Composites of 4A and 5A have greater sensitivity values over that of the pure polyaniline at the CO concentration range between 16 and 1000 ppm. Zeolite 5A is the most effective mesoporous material in promoting interaction between CO and polyaniline because of its largest pore size of 5 {\AA}, relative to the zeolite 3A and 4A which have the pore sizes of 4 and 3 {\AA}, respectively. {\textcopyright} 2004 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The alloying effects on the stability of vanadium hydrides have been investigated systematically for binary V–M and ternary V–Ti–M alloys, where M's are various alloying elements. The PCT curves for the $\beta$ phase (V2H or VH) are measured at low hydrogen pressures using an electrochemical method. On the other hand, for the $\gamma$ phase (VH2), the PCT curves are measured at high hydrogen pressures using an ordinary Sieverts-type apparatus. It is found that the phase stability of vanadium hydrides is affected strongly by the presence of a small amount of elements added to vanadium metal. The alloying effects on the hydride stability are different between the $\gamma$ phase and the $\beta$ phase. For example, the $\gamma$ phase becomes most unstable when the group 8 elements in the periodic table, Fe, Ru and Os, are added to vanadium metal. On the other hand, the stability of the $\beta$ phase changes monotonously following the order of elements in the periodic table. Also, the efficiency of alloying element in modifying the hydride stability is found to be different between the $\beta$1 phase (V2H) and the $\beta$2 phase (VH). In addition, it is shown that the logarithm of the plateau pressures for the $\beta$1 and the $\gamma$ phases change almost linearly with the amount of alloying element in the alloy. Using this linear relationship for the $\gamma$ phase, the second plateau pressures of ternary V–Ti–Ru and V–Ti–Cr alloys can be estimated quantitatively in the wide compositional range.},

Our results revealed that the underneath AgNWs play a role as a network for providing a carrier transfer pathway, thus the rGO/AgNWs gas sensor device showed a stable, reproducible response and full recovery in nitrogen at RT. However, an excess amount of the AgNWs resulted in the agglomeration of the AgNWs.

The results illustrated that the thermal stability of composite polymeric membranes was enhanced by addition of ZSM-5 or reduced by PVP. For ZSM-5 or PVP composite carbon membranes prepared at 650 °C, the O2permeability is 199.70 Barrer or 124.89 Barrer, and the O2/N2selectivity is 10.3 or 4.2, respectively.

However, the conventional analysis of diffusive transport through a membrane fails in the case of single layer graphene (SLG) and other 2D atomically thin membranes. In this work, analytical expressions are derived for gas permeation through such atomically thin membranes in various limits of gas diffusion, surface adsorption, or pore translocation as the rate-limiting step. Gas permeation can proceed via direct gas-phase interaction with the pore, or interaction via the adsorbed phase on the membrane exterior surface. A series of van der Waals force fields allows for the estimation of the energy barriers present for various types of graphene nanopores. These analytical models will assist in the understanding of molecular dynamics and experimental studies of such membranes.},

abstract = {superhydrophobic surfaces can be used to reduce the minimum voltage and to increase the maximum speed under certain conditions, but there are some harmful side-effects. First of all, the electrostatic pressure can push water into the surface pores, which hinders actuation. The phenomenon can also be treated as a vertical electrowetting effect. Another drawback is that the use of superhydrophobic surfaces makes actuation more critical to the properties of the liquid. For example, actuation of biological buffer solutions was not successful. For these reasons, it is concluded that it is more beneficial to use a smooth surface with low hysteresis than a superhydrophobic surface in droplet actuation. Electrostatic droplet actuation is a potential method for manipulating liquid on a microscopic scale, but there is still work to do. This work contains a detailed examination of the droplet actuation mechanism, and trapping of charges in the solid-liquid interface is found to be the most severe problem that needs to be solved.},

abstract = {Palladium (Pd) based alloy membranes of PdAu and PdAuPt were fabricated using magnetron sputtering. Membranes ranging in thickness from 9 to 33$\mu$m were tested under pure gas and mixed gas conditions including U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) specified simulated synthesis gas mixtures containing H 2, H 2O, CO and CO 2, and up to 75ppmv H 2S. In pure hydrogen gas, the PdAu alloy exhibited higher permeabilities than pure Pd in agreement with published values for cold rolled and electrodeposited membranes of similar compositions. The addition of Pt in concentrations ranging from 4.3 to 12.9mass{\%} lowered the permeability in pure hydrogen gas to slightly below pure Pd. For thicker (25-33$\mu$m) PdAuPt membranes pretreated in air (versus nitrogen) at 400°C before exposure to hydrogen, an increase in permeability of 10-20{\%} was observed, which is lower than that reported in the literature suggesting that some surface properties of thinner foils may boost permeability. A thick (33$\mu$m) Pd-10Au-10Pt foil evaluated under the DOE conditions, showed good recovery in flux after exposure to syngas containing sulfur. The flux dropped from 0.212 to 0.167molm -2s -1 when 20ppmv of H 2S was added to the gas mixture. When the H 2S was removed from the gas mixture the flux returned to its original value of 0.212molm -2s -1. However, in the presence of H 2S the permeate purity somewhat degraded over time. The hydrogen permeability, as observed for other membranes, was depressed both by water-gas shift mixtures (with or without H 2S) but it appears that either high quantities of Au or the presence of Pt, or both, are inhibiting sulfide formation, thereby improving both permeability and stability under mixture gas conditions with H 2S. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

For nanorod arrays of optimal diameter and distribution, these structures were proved to exert an enhanced sensitivity to reductive gases (especially H2S), which was twice as high as that obtained using SnO2 nanorod flowers. The improved sensing properties are attributed to the synergism of the large surface area of SnO2 nanorod arrays and the superior electronic characteristics of graphene.},

abstract = {Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) are typically highlighted for their potential application in gas storage, separations and catalysis. In contrast, the unique prospects these porous and crystalline materials offer for application in electronic devices, although actively developed, are often underexposed. This review highlights the research aimed at the implementation of MOFs as an integral part of solid-state microelectronics. Manufacturing these devices will critically depend on the compatibility of MOFs with existing fabrication protocols and predominant standards. Therefore, it is important to focus in parallel on a fundamental understanding of the distinguishing properties of MOFs and eliminating fabrication-related obstacles for integration. The latter implies a shift from the microcrystalline powder synthesis in chemistry labs, towards film deposition and processing in a cleanroom environment. Both the fundamental and applied aspects of this two-pronged approach are discussed. Critical directions for future research are proposed in an updated high-level roadmap to stimulate the next steps towards MOF-based microelectronics within the community.},

abstract = {The aim of this paper is to evaluate the roll-out of a hydrogen refuelling station (HRS) infrastructure in the Member States of Europe Union. The effort contributes to a preliminary, indicative assessment of the commercial viability and profitability of a hydrogen refuelling station network roll-out. In these concrete cases were provided scenarios at both the Member States and Europe Union levels. The business case assessment was realised for the roll-out of HRS network in a 15 years program. The results refer to key metrics to assess the overall profitability of the investment: the annual number evolution of HRSs based on the inputs provided by the user; the annual number evolution of FCEVs; annual total amount of hydrogen sold; annual capital expenditures on HES procurement (CAPEX); cash flow after interest and debt payment representing the cash flow available for equity holders; annual debt service coverage ratio (ADSCR); and net present value (NPV) at the end of the period. The first scenarios were designed to achieve results across the Member States of Europe Union. There were presented three individual detailed examples also. A second series of sensitivity analyses consider that the hydrogen mobility penetration appears more constrained, being limited to a few stakeholders in the EU with well-defined policies and programs or with more favourable conditions. Both categories of scenarios outline the idea that at the beginning of a HRS network development it is already good to have an adequate number of FCEVs for a profitable programme. The net present value (NPV) is positive and the development program is commercially viable if there is a correlation between both the HRS number and FCEV fleet dimension. This correlation leads to good or optimistic results, but for the majority NPV became positive only in the second part of the program. The roll-out's analysis of the hydrogen refuelling station network in the EU indicated that hydrogen is a part of solutions for a decarbonisation of the transport sector. There is a need to carefully develop an adequate hydrogen refuelling infrastructure if the final scope of the program is its commercial viability and profitability.},

abstract = {Thermal desorption spectroscopy and LEED have been used to investigate the interaction of CO and hydrogen with a Pd0.75Cu0.25(111) single crystal surface with surface composition of about Pd0.7Cu0.3. The main objective was to make a comparison with the previously studied Pd0.67Ag0.33(111) (surface composition Pd0.1Ag0.9) and Pd(111) surfaces. In addition, the effect of preadsorbed H on subsequent CO dosage and the effect of adsorbed CO on postdosed hydrogen are described. Marked differences were found in the adsorption behaviour of the three surfaces towards CO and hydrogen. The maximum amount of H and CO that can be adsorbed at 250 K and pressures below 10-9 mbar is much lower on the PdCu surface than expected on the basis of the surface composition. This effect appears to be caused by a low heat of adsorption of hydrogen and CO and Pd singlet sites. Arguments are presented that singlet Pd sites or isolated Pd atoms in a Cu or Ag matrix are able to trap and dissociate the hydrogen molecule at 250 K. The CO desorption spectra are not influenced by pre- or postexposed hydrogen. Adsorbed CO hampers the uptake of hydrogen upon subsequent exposure to hydrogen. Postdosed CO causes adsorbed H adatoms to move to the bulk (adsorbed H). CO exposure at 250 K results in a very broad desorption plateau between 310 and 425 K with hardly discernable maxima. The results can be explained in terms of the size and relative concentration of the various Pd sites present on the surface (triplet, doublet and singlet sites). It can be concluded that for Pd (111) the heat of adsorption of both CO and H differ appreciably for the triplet, doublet and singlet sites. The effect of site has a larger contribution to the decrease of the heat of adsorption with coverage than the effect of lateral interaction in the adlayer. For Pd(111), PdCu(111) and PdAg(111) the effect of the available Pd sites is the major effect that determines the heat of adsorption, followed by the effect of lateral interaction and for the alloy surfaces the electronic or ligand effect. ?? 1986.},

abstract = {Oxygen permeation through BSCF perovskite hollow fiber membranes has been investigated in a laboratory scale reactor in a temperature range of 850???1000 ??C at atmospheric pressure. An experimental study was conducted with particular focus on a new sealing technique which was found to provide fully gas-tight conditions with a 100{\%} success rate for the 6 membranes reported in this work (and for 15 membranes in total). An overview of experimental tests on other sealants proposed in the literature is given. A new method for checking the sealing is suggested that allows detecting the possible leakages in all the parts of the membrane module. A loose-end reactor with a shell-and-tube layout is presented which allows accurate measurements of both gas leakages (if any) and product gas composition in a wide range of operating conditions (flow rates on both the permeate and feed side, O2 feed partial pressure, temperature). Permeation fluxes were studied for BSCF membranes with different thicknesses (0.2 and 0.5 mm) using He as sweep gas. The O2 flux increased with both increasing the O2 driving force (i.e., the O2 partial pressure difference through the dense ceramic layer) and the reactor temperature. Long term tests (600 h) have been carried out proving the high stability of both the membranes used and the newly proposed sealing technique. The presence of both O2 bulk diffusion and surface exchange resistance is suggested to limit the permeation rate of the ceramic hollow fibers for the range of wall thicknesses investigated. Finally, LSCF capillaries have also been successfully sealed allowing to extend the use of the proposed gas tight sealing system to different compositions of hollow fibers perovskite membranes.},

abstract = {PdAgAu alloy films were prepared on porous stainless steel supports by sequential electroless deposition. Two specific compositions, Pd83Ag2Au15 and Pd74Ag14Au12, were studied for their sulfur tolerance. The alloys and a reference Pd foil were exposed to 1000H2S/H2 at 623 K for periods of 3 and 30 h. The microstructure, morphology and bulk composition of both non-exposed and H2S-exposed samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). XRD and SEM analysis revealed time-dependent growth of a bulk Pd4S phase on the Pd foil during H2S exposure. In contrast, the PdAgAu ternary alloys displayed the same FCC structure before and after H2S exposure. In agreement with the XRD and SEM results, sulfur was not detected in the bulk of either ternary alloy samples by EDS, even after 30 h of H2S exposure. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) depth profiles were acquired for both PdAgAu alloys after 3 and 30 h of exposure to characterize sulfur contamination near their surfaces. Very low S 2p and S 2s XPS signals were observed at the top-surfaces of the PdAgAu alloys, and those signals disappeared before the etch depth reached ∼10 nm, even for samples exposed to H2S for 30 h. The depth profile analyses also revealed silver and gold segregation to the surface of the alloys; preferential location of Au on the alloys surface may be related to their resistance to bulk sulfide formation. In preliminary tests, a PdAgAu alloy membrane displayed higher initial H2 permeability than a similarly prepared pure Pd sample and, consistent with resistance to bulk sulfide formation, lower permeability loss in H2S than pure Pd.},

abstract = {In this work high quality cobalt oxide silica membranes were synthesized on alumina supports using a sol-gel, dip coating method. The membranes were subsequently connected into a steel module using a graphite based proprietary sealing method. The sealed membranes were tested for single gas permeance of He, H2, N2and CO2at temperatures up to 600°C and feed pressures up to 600 kPa. Pressure tests confirmed that the sealing system was effective as no gas leaks were observed during testing. A H2permeance of 1.9 × 10-7mol m-2s-1Pa-1was measured in conjunction with a H2/CO2permselectivity of more than 1500, suggesting that the membranes had a very narrow pore size distribution and an average pore diameter of approximately 3 {\AA}. The high temperature testing demonstrated that the incorporation of cobalt oxide into the silica matrix produced a structure with a higher thermal stability, able to resist thermally induced densification up to at least 600°C. Furthermore, the membranes were tested for H2/CO2binary feed mixtures between 400 and 600°C. At these conditions, the reverse of the water gas shift reaction occurred, inadvertently generating CO and water which increased as a function of CO2feed concentration. The purity of H2in the permeate stream significantly decreased for CO2feed concentrations in excess of 50 vol{\%}. However, the gas mixtures (H2, CO2, CO and water) had a more profound effect on the H2permeate flow rates which significantly decreased, almost exponentially as the CO2feed concentration increased. {\textcopyright} 2012 Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

Specifically, Pr-, Fe- and Mn-doped BaZr1-x-yYxMyO3-delta compounds were prepared by solid state reaction. The compound exhibiting the highest total and protonic conductivity at elevated temperatures under reducing atmospheres was BaZr0.8Y0.15Mn0.05O3-delta. Temperature-programmed reduction experiments revealed a particular redox behavior related to the Mn-species under selected conditions. The hydrogen permeation was thoroughly studied as a function of the temperature, hydrogen concentration and the humidification degree in the sweep gas. Moreover, the transient processes induced by alternate step changes in the humidification degree of the sweep gas were analysed. The highest steady hydrogen evolution flow exceeded 0.03 ml min(-1) cm(-2) (0.9 mm-thick membrane) at 1000 degrees C for the humidified sweep gas. The stability of BaZr0.8Y0.15M0.05O3-delta under operation-relevant atmospheres (CO2-rich reducing atmosphere at high temperature) was tested using different techniques ( X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman, SEM, TEM and TG) and the results showed that this material is stable even when exposed to 115 ppm H2S.},

abstract = {The traceable and accurate measurement of biogas impurities is essential in order to robustly assess compliance with the specifications for biomethane being developed by CEN/TC408. An essential part of any procedure aiming to determinate the content of impurities is the sampling and the transfer of the sample to the laboratory. Key issues are the suitability of the sample container and minimising the losses of impurities during the sampling and analysis process. In this paper, we review the state-of-the-art in biogas sampling with the focus on trace impurities. Most of the vessel suitability studies reviewed focused on raw biogas. Many parameters need to be studied when assessing the suitability of vessels for sampling and storage, among them, permeation through the walls, leaks through the valves or physical leaks, sorption losses and adsorption effects to the vessel walls, chemical reactions and the expected initial concentration level. The majority of these studies looked at siloxanes, for which sampling bags, canisters, impingers and sorbents have been reported to be fit-for-purpose in most cases, albeit with some limitations. We conclude that the optimum method requires a combination of different vessels to cover the wide range of impurities commonly found in biogas, which have a wide range of boiling points, polarities, water solubilities, and reactivities. The effects from all the parts of the sampling line must be considered and precautions must be undertaken to minimize these effects. More practical suitability tests, preferably using traceable reference gas mixtures, are needed to understand the influence of the containers and the sampling line on sample properties and to reduce the uncertainty of the measurement.},

abstract = {The development of hydrogen energy systems has placed a high demand on hydrogen-permeable membranes as compact hydrogen separators and purifiers. Although Pd/Ceramic composite membranes are particularly effective in this role, the high cost of these membranes has greatly limited their applications; this high cost stems largely from the use of expensive substrate material. This problem may be solved by substrate recycling and the use of lower cost substrates. As a case study, we employed expensive asymmetric microporous Al2O3 and low-cost macroporous symmetric Al 2O3 as membrane substrates (average pore sizes are 0.2 and 3.3 ??m, respectively). The palladium membranes were fabricated by electroless plating, and substrate recycling was carried out by palladium dissolution with a hot HNO3 solution. The functional surface layer of the microporous Al2O3 was damaged during substrate recycling, and the reuse of the substrate led to poor membrane selectivity. With the assistance of pencil coating as a facile and environmentally benign surface treatment, the macroporous Al2O3 can be successfully utilized. Furthermore, the macroporous Al2O3 can be also recycled and reused as membrane substrate, yielding highly permeable, selective and stable palladium membranes. Consequently, the substrate cost can be further decreased, and the applications of this kind of membranes would expand. ?? 2011, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Colloidal zeolites LTA and BEA sized below 100 nm were synthesized as building blocks for the controlled growth of thin microporous films on piezoelectric sensor devices (quartz crystal microbalance, QCM). The zeolite films were prepared on pre-seeded gold substrates on QCM devices. Initially, a layer of colloidal particles was deposited on the support through chemical bonding with a silane coupling agent, followed by hydrothermal growth. BEA- and LTA-type zeolite films with thicknesses of 250 and 450 nm, respectively, were prepared by optimizing the synthesis conditions. The application of these zeolite films in microsensors for water and organic compounds is presented. The importance of the zeolite structure type with respect to the sensitivity towards different organic and water vapors at various concentrations is discussed. Both zeolites are thermally stable and show reproducible responses during long-term experiments. Based on these results, it was concluded that both zeolite films could be used effectively as humidity sensor materials for water vapor sensing purposes. High sensitivity, good reversibility and long life were demonstrated for this type of zeolite film at low water concentrations. In comparison to LTA, the BEA films show a higher sorption capacity towards water vapor and no rejection of pentane, hexane and cyclohexane, due to the larger pore size of the BEA structure. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {The gas sensor response of tin monoxide micro-disks, functionalized with noble metal nanoparticles (Pd and Ag), to NO2, H2 and CO were studied by monitoring changes in their resistance upon exposure to the various gases. The tin monoxide, with unusually low Sn oxidation state, was synthetized by carbothermal reduction. Surface modification by Pd and Ag catalysts was achieved by coating the micro-disks by metallic nanoparticle dispersions, prepared by the polyol reduction process, followed by thermal treatment. SEM and TEM analysis showed nanoparticles to be well-dispersed over the SnO surfaces. The decorated SnO micro-disks exhibited high sensor response to reducing gases such as H2 and CO. On the other hand, the catalytic particles tended to reduce the sensor response to oxidizing gases such as NO2. The catalytic activity of Pd nanoparticles was tied to chemical sensitization while that of Ag nanoparticles to electronic sensitization. Impedance spectroscopy enabled deconvolution of different contributions to the sensor response with only the Ag-decorated specimens exhibiting two RC time constants. Thus, in contrast to undecorated and Pd-decorated specimens, nearly 80{\%} of Ag modified SnO's response to H2 was controlled by changes in the interface between particles and disks. Sensor response to H2 was optimal at higher temperatures (300????C), NO2 at 200????C while that for Pd-decorated materials; maximum sensor response to CO was observed at lower temperatures (under 150????C), where CO absorption by metal nanoparticles is favored.},

abstract = {In this study, we present a comparative environmental impact assessment of possible hydrogen production methods from renewable and non-renewable sources with a special emphasis on their application in Turkey. It is aimed to study and compare the performances of hydrogen production methods and assess their economic, social and environmental impacts, The methods considered in this study are natural gas steam reforming, coal gasification, water electrolysis via wind and solar energies, biomass gasification, thermochemical water splitting with a Cu–Cl and S–I cycles, and high temperature electrolysis. Environmental impacts (global warming potential, GWP and acidification potential, AP), production costs, energy and exergy efficiencies of these eight methods are compared. Furthermore, the relationship between plant capacity and hydrogen production capital cost is studied. The social cost of carbon concept is used to present the relations between environmental impacts and economic factors. The results indicate that thermochemical water splitting with the Cu–Cl and S–I cycles become more environmentally benign than the other traditional methods in terms of emissions. The options with wind, solar and high temperature electrolysis also provide environmentally attractive results. Electrolysis methods are found to be least attractive when production costs are considered. Therefore, increasing the efficiencies and hence decreasing the costs of hydrogen production from solar and wind electrolysis bring them forefront as potential options. The energy and exergy efficiency comparison study indicates the advantages of biomass gasification over other methods. Overall rankings show that thermochemical Cu–Cl and S–I cycles are primarily promising candidates to produce hydrogen in an environmentally benign and cost-effective way.},

This work presents the structural and electrochemical characterization of mixed conducting materials for the specific system Nd5.5W1−xMoxO11.25−$\delta$ (x = 0, 0.1, 0.5 and 1). Evolution of the crystalline structure is studied as a function of the sintering temperature. Shrinkage behavior is analyzed for all compositions in the temperature range from 1000 °C to 1500 °C and these compounds show high sintering activity even at relatively low temperatures. The total conductivity in different environments is studied systematically for samples sintered at 1350 °C. The H/D isotopic effect is also studied by DC-electrochemical measurements. H2 permeation is investigated for the selected compound Nd5.5W0.5Mo0.5O11.25−$\delta$ in the range of 700–1000 °C achieving values of 0.3 mL min−1 cm−2 for a 0.9 mm thick disc membrane.

It would be interesting to introduce a method for preparation of hollow fiber ceramic membranes, as this would unfold their applications to areas where high-temperature operation precludes the use of existing polymeric hollow fiber membranes. This chapter aims to elaborate the production of hollow fiber ceramic membranes using a phase inversion/sintering method, which is a three-step process, including (1) preparation of a spinning suspension; (2) spinning of ceramic hollow fiber precursors; and (3) final sintering. A detailed discussion on this method is provided and examples on fabrication and applications of yittria stabilized zirconia and various perovskite hollow fiber membranes are then given.},

Polyimides (Matrimid[registered sign]) and polysulfones are popular polymer matrices for MOF fillers. Presently investigated MOFs for MMMs include [Cu(SiF6)(4,4[prime or minute]-BIPY)2], [Cu3(BTC)2(H2O)3] (HKUST-1, Cu-BTC), [Cu(BDC)(DMF)], [Zn4O(BDC)3] (MOF-5), [Zn(2-methylimidazolate)2] (ZIF-8), [Zn(purinate)2] (ZIF-20), [Zn(2-carboxyaldehyde imidazolate)2] (ZIF-90), Mn(HCOO)2, [Al(BDC)([small mu ]-OH)] (MIL-53(Al)), [Al(NH2-BDC)([small mu ]-OH)] (NH2-MIL-53(Al)) and [Cr3O(BDC)3(F,OH)(H2O)2] (MIL-101) (4,4[prime or minute]-BIPY = 4,4[prime or minute]-bipyridine, BTC = benzene-1,3,5-tricarboxylate, BDC = benzene-1,4-dicarboxylate, terephthalate). MOF particle adhesion to polyimide and polysulfone organic polymers does not represent a problem. MOF-polymer MMMs are investigated for the permeability of the single gases H2, N2, O2, CH4, CO2 and of the gas mixtures O2/N2, H2/CH4, CO2/CH4, H2/CO2, CH4/N2 and CO2/N2 (preferentially permeating gas named first). Permeability increases can be traced to the MOF porosity. Since the porosity of MOFs can be tuned very precisely, which is not possible with polymeric material, MMMs offer the opportunity of significantly increasing the selectivity compared to the pure polymeric matrix. Additionally in most of the cases the permeability is increased for MMM membranes compared to the pure polymer. Addition of MOFs to polymers in MMMs easily yields performances similar to the best polymer membranes and gives higher selectivities than those reported to date for any pure MOF membrane for the same gas separation. MOF-polymer MMMs allow for easier synthesis and handability compared to pure MOF membranes.},

abstract = {B3LYP/LANL2DZ and B3LYP/6-31G(d)-restricted and -unrestricted calculations are employed to calculate energies and adsorption forms of formaldehyde adsorbed on planar and on tetrahedral Pd4 clusters and on a Pd4 cluster supported on Al10O15. Formaldehyde adsorbs on planar Pd4 in the eta(2)(C,O)-di-sigma adsorption mode, while on tetrahedral Pd4, it adsorbs in the eta(2)(C,O)-pi adsorption mode. The adsorption energy on planar Pd4 is -21.4 kcal x mol(-1), whereas for the tetrahedral Pd4 cluster, the adsorption energy is -13.2 kcal x mol(-1). The latter value is close to experimental findings (-12 to -14 kcal x mol(-1)). Adsorption of formaldehyde on Pd4 supported on an Al10O15 cluster leads essentially to the same result as that found for adsorption on the tetrahedral Pd4 cluster. Charge density analysis for the interaction between formaldehyde and the Pd4 clusters indicates strong backdonation in the eta(2) adsorption mode, leading to positive charge on the Pd4 cluster. NBO analysis shows that the highly coordinated octahedral aluminum atoms of Al10O15 donate electron density to the supported Pd4 cluster, while tetrahedral aluminum atoms with lower coordination number have acidic nature and therefore act as electron acceptors.},

abstract = {Composites of a copper-based metal-org. framework (MOF) and graphite oxide (GO) were tested for hydrogen sulfide removal at ambient conditions.  In order to understand the mechanisms of adsorption, the initial and exhausted samples were analyzed by various techniques including X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform IR spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analyses, and sorption of nitrogen.  Compared to the parent materials, an enhancement in hydrogen sulfide adsorption was found.  It was the result of phys. adsorption of water and H2S in the pore space formed at the interface between the MOF units and the graphene layers where the dispersive forces are the strongest.  Besides physisorption, reactive adsorption was found as the main mechanism of retention.  H2S mols. bind to the copper centers of the MOF.  They progressively react with the MOF units resulting in the formation of copper sulfide.  This leads to the collapse of the MOF structure.  Water enhances adsorption in the composites as it allows the dissoln. of hydrogen sulfide. [on SciFinder(R)]},

abstract = {NaA zeolite membranes were synthesized on top of both disk and tubular porous stainless steel substrates by the secondary growth method. The support seed stage was optimized, considering the seed synthesis conditions and the deposition method. The formation of the NaA zeolite on both the membrane and the residual powder collected at the bottom of the vessel after synthesis was corroborated by X-ray diffraction (XRD). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed the formation of a film with well-defined crystals with a cubic morphology characteristic of the NaA zeolite. The support modification with 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane improved the morphology and stability of the NaA zeolite membranes synthesized on top of porous stainless steel substrates. When vacuum was applied only in the last hydrothermal synthesis stage, a smooth zeolite layer was obtained on top of porous stainless steel supports. The single gas (H2, N2, CO2and CH4) and mixture (H2/N2and H2/CH4) perm-selective properties of the tubular membranes were evaluated as a function of temperature and pressure. Separation factors higher than the Knudsen coefficient were obtained in all membranes. The single gas H2and CO2permeation flux of the membranes increased with temperature indicating a preponderance of the activated diffusion over the Knudsen diffusion. The higher H2/CO2ideal separation factors were 7.6 and 5.6 for the more selective tubular membranes, at 453 K and 100 kPa.},

An ideal membrane for molecular separation should be as thin as possible to maximize its solvent flux, be mechanically robust to prevent it from fracture, and have well-defined pore sizes to guarantee its selectivity. Graphene is an excellent platform for developing size-selective membranes because of its atomic thickness, high mechanical strength, and chemical inertness. In this Perspective, we review the recent advancements on the fabrication of nanoporous graphene membranes and graphene oxide membranes (GOMs) for molecular separation. The methods of fabricating these membranes are summarized, and the mechanisms of molecular separation based on these two types of graphene membranes are compared. The challenges of synthesizing and transferring large-area nanoporous graphene membranes and engineering the performances of GOMs are discussed.},

abstract = {Stable inorganic membranes perm-selective to hydrogen will find applications in a number of important industrial processes including water gas shift reaction for hydrogen production. This paper reports a highly stable bilayer MFI zeolite membrane with good hydrogen separation characteristics. The membrane consists of a thin (2$\mu$m) ZSM-5 layer on a thick (8$\mu$m) silicalite base layer supported on macroporous $\alpha$-alumina with a yttria stabilized zirconia intermediate barrier layer. The zeolitic pores of the thin ZSM-5 layer were narrowed by catalytic cracking deposition (CCD). At 500°C, the bilayer zeolite membrane exhibits H2permeance of about 1.2×10-7molm-2s-1Pa-1, with H2to CO2, CO and H2O vapor selectivity respectively of about 23, 28 and 180. The membrane shows slightly improved separation properties (H2permeance, H2/CO and H2/CO2selectivity) as the feed side pressure increases during the test of separation of industrial relevant simulated gas mixture (25{\%} H2: 25{\%} CO: 25{\%} H2O: 25{\%} CO2, with 400ppm H2S) at 500°C for 24 days. Membrane reactor made of the bilayer zeolite membrane shows stable performance under water gas shift reaction conditions (500°C, H2O/CO=3, GHSV=60,000h-1, with a ceria doped iron oxide catalyst) in terms of CO conversion, H2recovery, and H2permeance and selectivity of the zeolite membrane. The unprecedented thermal and chemical stability and good separation properties of the bilayer zeolite membrane are related to its unique bilayer structure and synthesis methods. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Cermet membranes composited of Ni and doped barium cerate have been widely studied for hydrogen separation; however, their practical application is limited primarily by the relatively low permeation rate and instability of doped barium cerate in H2O and CO2 containing gases. Here we report our findings on the development of a thin-film cermet membrane consisting of Ni and BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.1Yb0.1O3−$\delta$ (BZCYYb), supported on a porous Ni–BZCYYb substrate. High fluxes of 1.12 and 0.49 ml min−1 cm−2 have been demonstrated at 900 °C and 700 °C, respectively, when hydrogen was used as the feed gas on one side and N2 as the sweep gas on the other side. Most importantly, the high-performance membrane can be easily fabricated by a cost-effective particle-suspension coating/co-firing process, offering great promise for large scale hydrogen separation applications.},

abstract = {Suspension-feeding behaviour in the scallop Chlamys farreri of 72 ± 1 mm shell length was studied in response to wide variations in the amount and composition of suspended seston. Clearance rates (CR; 1 h-1) with which scallops removed all particles larger than 3.9 $\mu$m equivalent spherical diameter varied over an order of magnitude, initially increasing to maxima in separate unimodal relations with different measures of dietary abundance that included total particulate volume (VOL; mm3 1-1), total particulate mass (TPM; mg 1-1), particulate organic mass (POM; mg 1-1), particulate organic carbon (POC; mg 1-1) and chlorophyll a (CHL; $\mu$g 1-1), before declining with further increases in seston concentration. Most variance in CR was associated with VOL (47{\%}), compared with TPM (29{\%}), POM (32{\%}), POC (29{\%}), PON (27{\%}) and CHL (20{\%}). This suggests morphological limits to feeding behaviour, as adjustments in CR were primarily dependent upon total seston volume, rather than any gravimetric measure of abundance. Nevertheless, stepwise regression indicated that VOL and CHL together accounted for as much as 58{\%} of the variance in CR; more than for VOL alone (p {\textless} 0.001), and more than twice that explained by gravimetric measures of TPM, POM or CHL. The associated relation was best described by a combination of two unimodal curves, predicting that CR increased with food availability to a maximum of 7.1 1 h-1 g-1 when VOL was 2.0 mm3 1-1 and CHL was 5.3 $\mu$g 1-1, before declining with further increases in either VOL or CHL. Response curves differed according to particle type. Most evidently, compared with silt-enriched diets, natural seawater contained about the same total chlorophyll 1-1, but with much lower average volume, with the result that maximal CR was significantly higher in natural seawater. These findings establish highly flexible regulation of CR. They also indicate that to understand regulatory responses in feeding to a mixed suspension of different particles, it is necessary to measure the separate significant influences of particle volume and seston composition, when the range of experimental conditions must span the lower extreme of naturally occurring concentrations. We impress how our findings help to reconcile hitherto apparent differences between previous reports of bivalve suspension-feeding behaviour. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract = {A novel electrochemical sensor based on Cu-MOF-199 [Cu-MOF-199 = Cu3(BTC)2 (BTC = 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylicacid)] and SWCNTs (single-walled carbon nanotubes) was fabricated for the simultaneous determination of hydroquinone (HQ) and catechol (CT). The modification procedure was carried out through casting SWCNTs on the bare glassy carbon electrode (GCE) and followed by the electrodeposition of Cu-MOF-199 on the SWCNTs modified electrode. Cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were performed to characterize the electrochemical performance and surface characteristics of the as-prepared sensor. The composite electrode exhibited an excellent electrocatalytic activity with increased electrochemical signals towards the oxidation of HQ and CT, owing to the synergistic effect of SWCNTs and Cu-MOF-199. Under the optimized condition, the linear response range were from 0.1 to 1453 $\mu$mol L-1 (RHQ = 0.9999) for HQ and 0.1-1150 $\mu$mol L-1 (RCT = 0.9990) for CT. The detection limits for HQ and CT were as low as 0.08 and 0.1 $\mu$mol L-1, respectively. Moreover, the modified electrode presented the good reproducibility and the excellent anti-interference performance. The analytical performance of the developed sensor for the simultaneous detection of HQ and CT had been evaluated in practical samples with satisfying results.},

This review seeks to define the current scientific, technological and commercial boundaries of the field of membrane-based gas separation and to project the position of these boundaries for the immediate future. The most understandable connection between these three areas lies in the material science and engineering achievements and limitations that dominate the application of the technology at the present time. Achievements over the past ten to fifteen have promoted the current strong interest in membrane-based gas separations, and the promise of steady progress toward removing remaining limitations suggests the likelihood of its long term growth as a field.

Based on self-consistent calculations of the electrostatic potential around a series of atoms outside a jellium surface, it is shown that a simple electrostatic interaction can explain a large number of experimental observations concerning the influence of pre-adsorbed atoms on the adsorption rate, stability and adsorption configuration of simple molecules on metal surfaces. The role of pre-adsorbed alkalis as promoters and of electronegative atoms like P, S, Cl and O as poisons for the adsorption of electron acceptor molecules like H2, O2, N2 and CO is discussed, as well as the relative magnitude of the influence of the alkalis and the electronegative atoms. The peculiar effects that pre-adsorbed atoms have on molecules like H2O and NH3 are ascribed to the large intra-molecular electron transfer in these molecules. {\textcopyright} 1985.},

abstract = {From the early of 1990s, intensive research has been started to seek a possible more efficient gas separation using inorganic membranes with more hopes on zeolite membrane. Although prohibitive difficulties have been encountered, our enthusiasm or imagination has never been quenched out, particular with the modern era of “magic” material-graphene. In this work, we explored the possibility of using supported graphene oxide (GO) membrane for gas separation. For this purpose, the porous YSZ hollow fiber ceramic support and GO flakes with size up to 5 µm were separately prepared; subsequently, vacuum-suction impregnation was applied to assemble the GO laminates on the fiber external surface with the thickness of 230 nm. The 2D nano-channels formed by the two neighboring one-atom-thick GO layers endow the membrane with molecular-sieving function. Gas permeation behavior was investigated by the measurement of gas permeances from the single gas components and the gas mixture (H2/N2). The ideal selectivity of H2/N2at 20 oC was up to 76, mirroring the molecular sieving function via molecular size limited diffusion and preferable adsorption. Compared to the ideal selectivity, the H2/N2separation factor is lower due to the blocking effect of the other components. At higher temperature, N2permeance was increased by a percentage more than that of H2thus decreasing the separation factor from 68 (20 oC) to 37 (100 oC). The H2separation test for 240 h highlights stable performance in maintaining the separation factor and the permeance. H2permeation using GO/YSZ hollow fiber was also theoretically probed. Simulation implies that in achieving the overall H2permeance, the front part (near the inlet) of the hollow fiber makes much more contribution than the rear part. To more effectively use the GO hollow fiber, the feed gas pressure can be increased or the vacuum pressure can be applied in the permeate side.},

The high-temperature hydrogen adsorption property of the precursor-derived composite powders was investigated in comparison with the amorphous Si-O and Ni at 773 K. Among the three powder samples, Ni nanoparticle-dispersed amorphous Si-O exhibited a unique reversible hydrogen adsorption property that was hardly detected on the amorphous Si-O and Ni. The increase amount of the reversibly adsorbed hydrogen was the highest for the composite samples at around the Ni content with a Ni/(Si+Ni) ratio of 0.2-0.3. The results strongly suggested that when the composite material is used in the form of a gas separation membrane, the reversibly adsorbed hydrogen property is thought to contribute to the additional increase in the number of solubility sites for hydrogen, which leads to a selective enhancement in the high-temperature hydrogen permeance at 773 K. {\textcopyright} 2006 The American Ceramic Society.},

Cellulosic precursors were regenerated from CA hollow fibers using an optimized deacetylation process, which were further used for preparation of HFCMs using a specific carbonization procedure. Membrane separation performances of the prepared HFCMs were tested by gas permeation measurements for single gas and gas mixtures, while the carbon membrane stability and durability were documented by exposing the membranes to a real flue gas containing water vapor and acid gases of SO2and NOx. HYSYS simulation was also conducted to evaluate the process feasibility of CO2capture by HFCMs in a post combustion process.

Much effort has been dedicated to improving the hydrogen flux of these membranes employing different alloys, supports, deposition/production techniques, etc. High flux and cheap membranes, yet stable at different operating conditions are required for their exploitation at industrial scale. The integration of membranes in multifunctional reactors (membrane reactors) poses additional demands on the membranes as interactions at different levels between the catalyst and the membrane surface can occur. Particularly, when employing the membranes in fluidized bed reactors, the selective layer should be resistant to or protected against erosion. In this review we will also describe a novel kind of membranes, the pore-filled type membranes prepared by Pacheco Tanaka and coworkers that represent a possible solution to integrate thin selective membranes into membrane reactors while protecting the selective layer. This work is focused on recent advances on metallic supports, materials used as an intermetallic diffusion layer when metallic supports are used and the most recent advances on Pd-based composite membranes. Particular attention is paid to improvements on sulfur resistance of Pd based membranes, resistance to hydrogen embrittlement and stability at high temperature.},

To enhance gas separation performances, recent works have focused on improving polymeric membranes selectivity and permeability by fabricating mixed matrix membranes (MMMs). Inorganic zeolite materials distributed in the organic polymer matrix enhance the separation performance of the membranes well beyond the intrinsic properties of the polymer matrix. This concept combines the advantages of both components: high selectivity of zeolite molecular sieve, and mechanical integrity as well as economical processability of the polymeric materials. In this paper gas permeation mechanism through polymeric and zeolitic membranes, material selection for MMMs and their interaction with each other were reviewed. Also, interfacial morphology between zeolite and polymer in MMMs and modification methods of this interfacial region were discussed. In addition, the effect of different parameters such as zeolite loading, zeolite pore size, zeolite particle size, etc. on gas permeation tests through MMMs was critically reviewed. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Korean Society of Industrial and Engineering Chemistry.},

abstract = {Nonstoichiometric mixed perovskites A3B???1+xB???2-xO9-??, e.g. Ba3Ca1.18Nb1.82O9-??, exhibit high proton and oxygen-ion conductivity. It is expected that mixed ionic and electronic conductors may be found in these compounds if the B-sites are partially substituted by a first row transition element. These mixed conductors may be potential anode materials for fuel cell applications. The structure of single phase SrCu0.4Nb0.6O2.9 was studied by both X-ray and neutron diffraction. It is tetragonal with space group P4/mmm (123), a=3.9608(4) ??, c=3.9757(2) ??, V=62.37(2) ??3 according to neutron diffraction. Rietveld refinement indicates that the oxygen vacancy tends to stay at O1 (1c) site with O2 (2e) fully occupied. AC impedance measurements indicate that electronic conduction is probably dominant in air. The DC conductivity of SrCu0.4Nb0.6O2.9 at pO2 in the range of 10-22-10-12 atm exhibits a p(O2) -1/4 dependence consistent with n-type electronic conduction. The material was unstable in 5{\%} H2 at elevated temperatures but stable in argon at 900 ??C. Using manganese instead of copper, a phase that is redox stable was prepared. SrMn0.4Nb0.6O3-?? exhibits an orthorhombic structure with space group Pbnm (62), a=5.6451(3) ??, b=5.6589(2) ??, c=7.9729(2) ??, V=254.69(7) ??3 according to X-ray diffraction. Such a unit cell indicates that it is a double perovskite and therefore the formula is better written as Sr2Mn0.8Nb1.2O6-??. The material maintains perovskite structure in 5{\%} H2 although thermal expansion was observed on reduction. The conductivity of Sr2Mn0.8Nb1.2O6 is 0.36 S/cm in air at 900 ??C. Conductivity decreases in 5{\%} H2 indicates p-type conduction at low pO2. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {This paper deals with the ground state of an interacting electron gas in an external potential v(r). It is proved that there exists a universal functional of the density, F[n(r)], independent of v(r), such that the expression E≡∫v(r)n(r)dr+F[n(r)] has as its minimum value the correct ground-state energy associated with v(r). The functional F[n(r)] is then discussed for two situations: (1) n(r)=n0+ñ(r), ñ/n0≪1, and (2) n(r)=ϕ(r/r0) with ϕ arbitrary and r0→∞. In both cases F can be expressed entirely in terms of the correlation energy and linear and higher order electronic polarizabilities of a uniform electron gas. This approach also sheds some light on generalized Thomas-Fermi methods and their limitations. Some new extensions of these methods are presented.},

abstract = {Free-standing paper-like or foil-like materials are an integral part of our technological society. Their uses include protective layers, chemical filters, components of electrical batteries or supercapacitors, adhesive layers, electronic or optoelectronic components, and molecular storage. Inorganic 'paper-like' materials based on nanoscale components such as exfoliated vermiculite or mica platelets have been intensively studied and commercialized as protective coatings, high-temperature binders, dielectric barriers and gas-impermeable membranes. Carbon-based flexible graphite foils composed of stacked platelets of expanded graphite have long been used in packing and gasketing applications because of their chemical resistivity against most media, superior sealability over a wide temperature range, and impermeability to fluids. The discovery of carbon nanotubes brought about bucky paper, which displays excellent mechanical and electrical properties that make it potentially suitable for fuel cell and structural composite applications. Here we report the preparation and characterization of graphene oxide paper, a free-standing carbon-based membrane material made by flow-directed assembly of individual graphene oxide sheets. This new material outperforms many other paper-like materials in stiffness and strength. Its combination of macroscopic flexibility and stiffness is a result of a unique interlocking-tile arrangement of the nanoscale graphene oxide sheets.},

Cr3C2 was processed using wet grinding exfoliation to achieve flakes and small particles of the material. Based on the working principle and sensing results of the single layered sensors, a novel bi-layered structure was proposed and fabricated with stable linear response and good sensitivity. The sensors are capable of measuring percentage relative humidity accurately in range of 0{\%} RH to 90{\%} RH with an absolute change of 660 $\Omega$/{\%}RH and fast response and recovery times of 1 s and 1.9 s respectively. The sensors can also work with simple frequency based read-out circuit with a highly linear and stable response. The fabricated sensors are cheap, easy to fabricate, and are ideal to be used in high end environmental and health monitoring applications.},

abstract = {Molecular simulations were performed to characterize hydrated Nafion membranes in terms of gas adsorption, diffusion, and permeation. The experimental results validate the molecular model of Nafion with respect to material density, morphology, free volume, and water diffusivity. Nafion's adsorption property is examined in terms of the solubility and adsorption isotherms for gases, including H(2), O(2), and N(2). The adsorption capacity of hydrated Nafion is shown to be strong for O(2) and N(2) but not for H(2). Due to the dilution effect, N(2) is able to suppress the loading of O(2) and protect the fuel cell from fuel crossover. The dynamic behaviors of H(2) and O(2) are represented by self-diffusion coefficients, with the results showing that H(2) diffusion in Nafion membranes is nearly 1 order of magnitude faster than O(2) diffusion. The effects of water content and the concentration of adsorbed gases were verified, and a close correlation of Nafion free volume to gas transport properties was revealed. On the basis of the solution-diffusion mechanism, the permeabilities of H(2) and O(2) in hydrated Nafion membranes are calculated and compared with corresponding experiments, and the permeability of H(2) is found to be approximately twice that of O(2).},

abstract = {Experiments on commercially available palladium-silver (PdAg) tubular membranes were carried out to: (1) verify the validity of both Sievert's and Fick's laws for H2 permeation through the membrane; (2) quantify the deactivating effects of methylcyclohexane (MCH), toluene (TOL), sulphur (S), and chlorine (Cl) on membrane permeability; and (3) develop regeneration procedures to restore the original H2 permeation rates. The results showed that the H2 permeability data were represented by Sievert's and Fick's laws. Initial exposure of the fresh membrane to MCH or TOL caused inhibiton of H2 permeation but after air oxidation, the membrane permeability was restored and constant for 32 h at 633 K in the presence of MCH. The H2 permeation rates through the membrane were 14{\%} lower in the presence of MCH or TOL. S and Cl poisoned the membrane strongly but redox procedures for S and a water vapour treatment for Cl were sufficient to restore the original H2 permeation rates. The application of a catalytic membrane reactor (CMR) with a sulphided, monometallic, commercial catalyst is illustrated for MCH dehydrogenation where twice the equilibrium value of TOL was obtained. {\textcopyright} 1994.},

abstract = {In the present study, the composite polyetherimide (PEI) membrane coated with poly dimethyl siloxane (PDMS) was synthesized and optimum conditions of coating were obtained for separation of hydrogen from methane. Three coating techniques "pouring solution inclined by 45°", "film casting" and "dip-coating" were used. The effect of sequential coating for different methods on permselectivity of the membranes was investigated. In addition, the influences of coating conditions including coating solution concentration, coating and curing temperatures were examined. The results showed that when the concentration of PDMS coating solution was increased; the permeance of H2was initially declined rapidly and was then gradually leveled off. The optimum concentration of coating solution was 15 wt.{\%}. The examination of the curing and coating temperatures showed no significant effect on H2permeance and selectivity. In the "dip coating" method, two times coating showed superior permeance and selectivity and in "film casting", the performance of triple coating was promising. Higher selectivities for the composite membrane prepared by "dip-coating" introduced this method as the best method. The sequential dip-coating with different PDMS concentrations was applied and the selectivity was enhanced significantly from 26 to 96 for pure gases and from 22 to 70 for the binary gas mixture. Finally, the influence of pressure on the separation performance of the fabricated membrane was investigated. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2014, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

abstract = {The stabilization of copper clusters in nanosized metal-organic framework crystals, Cu-Y(BTC), was achieved by a solvent-exchange approach, followed by hydrogen reduction. The formation of copper clusters in the Y(BTC) nanocrystals generated during the hydrogen reduction process was followed by UV-vis spectroscopy. The Cu-Y(BTC) nanocrystals were further assembled in thin films with a thickness of 250 nm. The distribution and size of the copper clusters in the films were studied by CO chemisorption, followed by FT-IR spectroscopy combined with transmission electron microscopy. It was shown that the copper clusters with a mean diameter of 6 nm were homogeneously distributed and stabilized in the Cu-Y(BTC) films. Further, the Cu-Y(BTC) films were utilized for detection of single harmful gases, such as CO, chloroform, and 2-ethylthiophene, or mixtures of two compounds. The high sensitivity, selectivity, and reversibility of the Cu-Y(BTC) films toward single CO, chloroform, and 2-ethylthiophene were demonstrated. Noteworthy, the Cu-Y(BTC) films exhibited a fast response toward CO, even in the presence of chloroform and 2-ethylthiophene, which was due to the high activity and accessibility of copper clusters. The response of Cu-Y(BTC) toward 2-ethylthiophene was slower in comparison with chloroform, which was attributed to the bigger size and higher viscosity of 2-ethylthiophene. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Chemical Society.},

It was possible to obtain dense samples with a low level of non-percolating silver (2 vol{\%}). Silver was present even if sintered at 1300 °C as it remained trapped in the ceramic matrix. The overall conductivity of a dense sample with 2 vol{\%} of silver increased when compared to pure BCZYZ, and in particular the grain boundary resistance decreased considerably.

abstract = {Bis(triethoxysilyl) ethane (BTESE), which consists of Si-C-C-Si bonds, was used as a silica precursor to prepare organic-inorganic hybrid silica membranes with loose amorphous networks. Single-gas permeation and binary-component gas separation characteristics for hybrid silica membranes were examined to discuss the effect of silica precursors on amorphous networks. The pore size distribution, as determined by single-gas permeation, suggested BTESE-derived silica membranes have loose amorphous structures compared to TEOS-derived silica membranes due to the differences in the minimum units of silica networks. For example, BTESE-derived silica membranes showed a high hydrogen permeance (0.2-1 ?? 10-5 mol m-2 s-1 Pa-1) with a high selectivity of H2 to SF6 (H2/SF6 permselectivity: 1000-25,500) and a low H2 to N2 permselectivity (???20). The binary-component gas separation of He and SF6 for a BTESE-derived silica membrane revealed that the swelling effect (adsorption-induced expansion of the zeolite crystals) by SF6 molecules, which has been suggested for zeolite membranes, was not observed in amorphous silica networks. In the present study, BTESE-derived silica membranes had high hydrothermal stability due to the presence of Si-C-C-Si bonds in the amorphous silica network. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The mass fraction of silver in the membrane obtained at a support-surface temperature of 1240–1340 K is as low as 0.04, while its fraction in the total metal mass dissolved in the spray solution is 0.1–0.4. This is explained by the higher partial pressure of silver compared to that of palladium. An additional spray pyrolysis with a silver nitrate solution provides a proper silver content in the alloy membrane. The thickness of the alloy membrane is 1.5–2 μm, and the separation factor of hydrogen to nitrogen is about 24 at 773 K. The membrane surface is observed by high-resolution SEM, and the evolution of the morphology is discussed from the view of the deposition mechanism."

The selected MOFs exhibited the strongest affinity for semi-volatile (polar) VOC molecules (skatole), whereas the weakest affinity toward was volatile (non-polar) VOC molecules (i.e., benzene). Our experimental results were also supported through simulation analysis in which polar molecules were bound most strongly to MOF-199, reflecting the presence of strong interactions of Cu 2+ with polar VOCs. In addition, the performance of selected MOFs was compared to three well-known commercial sorbents (Tenax TA, Carbopack X, and Carboxen 1000) under the same conditions. The estimated equilibrium adsorption capacity (mg.g-1) for the all target VOCs was in the order of; MOF-199 (71.7) {\textgreater}Carboxen-1000 (68.4) {\textgreater}Eu-MOF (27.9) {\textgreater}Carbopack X (24.3) {\textgreater}MOF-5 (12.7) {\textgreater}Tenax TA (10.6).

All ribbon specimens were confirmed to have a single amorphous phase by XRD analysis. The crystallization temperature of the melt-spun (Ni/sub 0.6/Nb/sub 0.4 /)/sub 45/Zr/sub 50/X/sub 5/(X=Al, P, Pd, Si or Sn) amorphous alloys are higher than that of the (Ni/sub 0.6/Nb/sub 0.4 /)/sub 50/Zr/sub 50/ amorphous alloy (727 K). Although the hydrogen permeability of the (Ni/sub 0.6/Nb/sub 0.4/)/sub 45/Zr/sub 50/X/sub 5 /(X=Si, Sn, Ta or Ti) amorphous alloys could not be measured due to severe embrittlement during the permeation test, the (Ni/sub 0.6/Nb /sub 0.4/)/sub 45/Zr/sub 50/X/sub 5/(X=Al, Co, Cu, P or Pd) amorphous alloys had high ductility which was enough to measure the permeability. The hydrogen permeabilities of the (Ni/sub 0.6/Nb /sub 0.4/)/sub 45/Zr/sub 50/Co/sub 5/ and the (Ni /sub 0.6/Nb/sub 0.4/)/sub 45/Zr/sub 50/Cu/sub 5 / amorphous alloys were 2.46*10/sup -8/ and 2.34*10/sup -8/[mol middot m/sup -1/ middot s/sup -1 / middot Pa/sup -1/2/] at 673 K, respectively. The (Ni/sub 0.6 /Nb/sub 0.4/)/sub 45/Zr/sub 50/P/sub 5/ amorphous alloy possesses the lowest permeability of 1.36*10/sup -8/(mol middot m/sup -1/ middot s/sup -1 / middot Pa-1/2] at 673 K among the alloys where the permeability was measured. The reduction of the permeability in the (Ni/sub 0.6/Nb/sub 0.4/)/sub 45/Zr/sub 50/P/sub 5 / amorphous alloy is thought to be due to the preferential formation of Zr-P atomic pairs which may suppress the hydrogen solubility and hydrogen diffusivity in the alloy. Since the heat of mixing for Zr-P atomic pairs is negatively larger than that for other pairs such as Ni-P and Nb-P. It is concluded that the Ni-Nb-Zr-X(X=Co or Cu) amorphous alloys have high potential to hydrogen permeable membranes.},

First method is called "safe method" as the flammability range is not crossed during cylinder filling due to the introduction of major component first in cylinder. The second method is called "accurate method" as minor component is introduced first in cylinder leading to a risk of explosion during the introduction of major component at the end while crossing the flammability domain. The diagrams representing the maximum filling pressure of filling to prevent any accident are given as a function of fuel concentration for lean and rich mixtures. These diagrams are deduced from flammability and detonation limits versus pressure at ambient temperature. Both methods have been applied to hydrogen-air mixtures.

abstract = {Hydrogen separation membrane devices are attracting increasing interest for the industrial production of hydrogen. Metal membranes, in particular, are promising due to their resilience to the demands of a typical hydrogen purification process. However, the use of too much Pd within the membranes limits their wide-scale industrial use due to excessive costs. The present article reviews the design, preparation, operation, and critical performance features of novel non-Pd-based alloys. The theory behind the permeation of hydrogen through metal membranes is presented as well as the materials and methods central to their design and improvement. Crystalline, amorphous, and thin layer metal membranes are contrasted, while the advanced experimental techniques and mechanical tests for their characterization are discussed. The review considers the design of novel metal membranes from first principles and assesses catalytic and protective surface layers which may enhance their hydrogen separation capabilities.},

abstract = {Zeolites are microporous, crystalline aluminosilicates with the framework made up of T-O-T (T = Si, Al) bonds and enclosed cages and channels of molecular dimensions. Influencing and manipulating the nucleation and growth characteristics of zeolites can lead to novel frameworks and morphologies, as well as decreased crystallization time. In this study, we show that manipulating the supersaturation during synthesis of zeolite X/Y (FAU) via dehydration led to extensive nucleation. Controlled addition of water to this nucleated state promotes the transport of nutrients, with a 4-fold increase in the rate of crystal growth, as compared to conventional hydrothermal process. Structural signature of the nucleated state was obtained by electron microscopy, NMR, and Raman spectroscopy. This extensively intermediate nucleated state was isolated and used as the starting material for zeolite membrane synthesis on porous polymer supports, with membrane formation occurring within an hour. With this time frame for growth, it becomes practical to fabricate zeolite/polymer membranes using roll-to-roll technology, thus making possible new commercial applications.},

abstract = {: Metal oxide semiconductor gas sensors are utilised in a variety of different roles and industries. They are relatively inexpensive compared to other sensing technologies, robust, lightweight, long lasting and benefit from high material sensitivity and quick response times. They have been used extensively to measure and monitor trace amounts of environmentally important gases such as carbon monoxide and nitrogen dioxide. In this review the nature of the gas response and how it is fundamentally linked to surface structure is explored. Synthetic routes to metal oxide semiconductor gas sensors are also discussed and related to their affect on surface structure. An overview of important contributions and recent advances are discussed for the use of metal oxide semiconductor sensors for the detection of a variety of gases—CO, NOx, NH3 and the particularly challenging case of CO2. Finally a description of recent advances in work completed at University College London is presented including the use of selective zeolites layers, new perovskite type materials and an innovative chemical vapour deposition approach to

abstract = {A novel microporous hybrid silica membrane for the separation of carbon dioxide, fabricated through sol-gel deposition of a microporous Nb-doped ethylene-bridged silsesquioxane layer on a multilayer porous support, was reported. Effect of the calcination temperature on H2/CO2separation properties of Nb-BTESE membrane was investigated. Low CO2permeance was imparted by doping acidic niobium centers into the hybrid silica networks. Denser hybrid silica networks as well as more Lewis acid sites were generated as the calcination temperature elevated, which imparted very low CO2permeance to the novel hybrid membrane while retaining its relative high H2flux in the order of ∼10-7molm-2s-1Pa-1. Dominant densification occurred in the Nb-doped hybrid silica networks when the calcination temperature was lower than 400°C. Meanwhile, the Nb-BTESE membrane showed relatively weak acidity which was induced by niobium doping. Dual effects are working when the heat-treated temperature was higher than 400°C. On the one hand, the increased surface acidity reduced the number of sites and/or affinity for adsorption of CO2as the calcination temperature elevated. On the other hand, membrane densification occurred during the calcination process. Therefore, the permselectivity of H2/CO2for Nb-BTESE membrane could be tuned by altering the calcination temperature. The Nb-BTESE membrane calcined at 450°C showed both relative high hydrogen permeance (∼9.7×10-8molm-2s-1Pa-1) and excellent H2/CO2permselectivity (220), as compared with Nb-BTESE membranes calcined at other temperatures. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The tungstates Ln6WO12 are proton-conducting materials exhibiting sufficient electronic conductivity to consider them as potential candidates for the separation of hydrogen at high temperature. Hydrogen-permeable membranes will find application in power plants applying precombustion strategies, process intensification using high-temperature catalytic membrane reactors, and in components for electrochemical systems as proton conducting fuel cells (PCFCs) and electrolyzers. This work presents the preparation and characterization of nanocrystalline mixed conducting materials with three different nominal compositions (Nd6WO12-Eu 6WO12-Er6WO12) using a ol-gel complexation synthesis method. The evolution of the crystalline structure and crystallite size is studied as a function of the sintering temperature. Generally, the nanosized oxides show a (pseudo)-cubic crystalline fluorite structure which evolves into the most stable fluorite symmetry (tetragonal for Nd and rhombohedral for Er) with increasing sintering temperatures, i.e., crystallite sizes. Shrinkage behavior was analyzed for the three compositions in the range from 1000 to 1500 ?C and the nanosized Nd-based oxide showed a very high sintering activity even at relatively low temperatures (1100-1200 ?C). In addition, the total conductivity in different environments has been studied systematically for samples sintered at different temperatures and the highest total conductivity was obtained for the Eu-based compound having structure with tetragonal symmetry (0.009 S/ cm at 850 ?C). Hydrogen permeation was studied for a disk-shaped Nd6WO12 membrane in the range of 700-1000 ?C. Finally, stability of these materials at 700 and 800 C has been evaluated in contactwith a CO2-rich gas stream (dry or humidified) as well as thermochemical compatibility with yttriastabilized zirconia in the range 1200-1500 ?C.},

abstract = {Here we show the long term performance at high temperatures of a multi-tube module containing 8 membranes in 4 parallel lines with a total of 545 cm2 area. The membranes were prepared via thin film dip coating of cobalt oxide silica (CoOxSi) sol-gel on tubular alumina supports. A preliminary study found that the sol-gel containing 20 mol{\%} cobalt oxide formed the best microporous structure with the highest surface area and pore volume. All resulting membranes delivered permeances of [similar]1 [times] 10-7 mol m-2 s-1Pa-1 at 500 [degree]C, indicating a high repeatability for the membrane fabrication process. The permselectivities of helium (He) and hydrogen (H2) over carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrogen (N2) increased from 10-20 at 100 [degree]C to values close to 1000 at 500 [degree]C. Additionally, the apparent energies of activation (Eact) for the smaller kinetic diameter gases He and H2 at 12.2 and 19.5 kJ mol-1 were high and contrary to the negative values for larger gases N2 and CO2 at -1.8 and -7.4 kJ mol-1. These remarkable results were attributed to the molecular sieving mechanism of the microporous silica which was enhanced by the embedding of cobalt oxide into the matrix, delivering structural control with an average pore size of 3 A. The Eact for H2 permeance was higher than that of He, indicating that the cobalt oxide played an important role in H2transport. Two membrane lines performed exceptionally well for binary gas mixture processing with H2 purity reaching values close to 100{\%} in the permeate stream for argon (Ar) concentrations of up to 80{\%} in the retentate stream. A major finding here is that the binary gas selectivity was independent of temperature, contrary to the permselectivity observed for single gas permeance. Further, the H2 flow rate was greatly affected by the concentration of Ar in the mixture, while the temperature dependency played only a marginal role. In particular, competitive adsorption in the percolative pathways containing pore constrictions or bottlenecks of the anisotropic CoOxSi matrix allowed Ar to impede H2 diffusion. Finally, the CoOxSi membranes proved thermally stable and robust for 2000 h of testing for various thermal cycles up to 500 [degree]C.},

On the films at 77 K, H2O adsorbs molecularly and binds to the surface through the O-atom as suggested by the decrease in work function. Data can be rationalized assuming that during TPD, the adsorbed H2O molecules undergo decomposition. H2 never evolved from the films, not even at 473 K, suggesting that the observed H2O desorption peak at T{\{}{\textgreater}{\}}220 K should involve molecule rebuilding, as found in Pd single crystals.},

Over the past 15 years, research and development of these materials have become one of the most intensely and extensively pursued areas. A very interesting and well-investigated topic is their optical emission properties and related applications. Several reviews have provided a comprehensive overview covering many aspects of the subject up to 2011. This review intends to provide an update of work published since then and focuses on the photoluminescence (PL) properties of MOFs and their possible utility in chemical and biological sensing and detection. The spectrum of this review includes the origin of luminescence in MOFs, the advantages of luminescent MOF (LMOF) based sensors, general strategies in designing sensory materials, and examples of various applications in sensing and detection.},

abstract = {The electrostatic interaction between two adsorbates, and, in particular, between an adsorbed atom and an adsorbed or adsorbing molecule is studied. Based on self-consistent calculations of the electrostatic potential around a series of atoms outside a jellium surface, it is shown that a simple electrostatic interaction can explain a large number of experimental observations concerning the influence of pre-adsorbed atoms on the adsorption rate, stability and adsorption configuration of simple molecules on metal surfaces. The role of pre-adsorbed alkalis as promoters and of electronegative atoms like P, S, Cl and O as poisons for the adsorption of electron acceptor molecules like H2, O2, N2 and CO is discussed, as well as the relative magnitude of the influence of the alkalis and the electronegative atoms. The peculiar effects that pre-adsorbed atoms have on molecules like H2O and NH3 are ascribed to the large intra-molecular electron transfer in these molecules. {\{}{\textcopyright}{\}} 1985.},

Dense membranes, prepared by solution-casting and subsequent evaporation, showed large differences in their thermal, mechanical and transport properties, depending on the residual solvent content. Complete solvent removal required heating under vacuum up to well above the glass transition temperature. Analysis of the permeability, diffusion and solubility coefficients of six permanent gases showed that plasticization by the residual solvent reduces the permselectivity and increases the permeability. Data of solution-cast membranes after complete solvent removal compare well with those of a melt-pressed sample. Experimental gas transport parameters were confronted with simulated data, obtained by the Gusev-Suter Transition-State Theory (TST) method and by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations.1H High Resolution Magic Angle Spinning Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spectroscopic analysis of the residual solvent in the polymer matrix did not reveal a particular interaction between polymer and solvent, suggesting that the solvent retention is mainly diffusion controlled. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {In this work we investigate the performance of cobalt silica membranes for the separation of gas mixtures at various temperatures and partial pressures. The membranes were prepared by a sol-gel process using tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) in ethanol and H2O2with cobalt nitrate hexahydrate (Co(NO3)26H2O). The membranes complied with molecular sieving transport mechanism, delivering high single gas selectivities for He/N2(4500) and H2/CO2(1000) and high activation energy for the smaller gas molecules (He, H2) whilst a negative activation energy for larger molecules (CO, CO2and N2). Molecular probing results strongly suggest membranes with a narrow pore size distribution with an average pore size of 3 {\AA}. The effect of gas composition on the membrane operation was studied over both binary and ternary gas mixtures, and compared with the single gas permeance results. It was found in both cases feed concentration had a large impact on both selectivities and flow rates. These followed a trade off inverse relationship, as increasing H2feed concentration led to a higher flow rate but a lower H2selectivity, though H2purity in the permeate stream increased. The use of sweep gas in the permeate stream to increase the driving force of gas permeation was beneficial as the H2flow rate and the H2recovery rate increased by a factor of 3. It is noteworthy to mention that though the ternary feed flow had only 27{\%} H2concentration, the permeate stream delivered CO and CO2at very low concentrations, 0.8 and 0.14{\%}, respectively. It was observed that the membrane selectivity in gas mixtures were 10-15{\%} of the single gas selectivity, while permeation decreased with the gas composition (Single {\textgreater} Binary {\textgreater} Ternary). Nevertheless, increased temperature and sweep flow rate allowed the membrane to deliver a permeate stream in excess of 99{\%} H2purity and a lower CO concentration of 700 ppm, indicating the quality of these membranes for gas mixture separation. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {We investigated the oxygen isotope composition ($\delta$18O) of shell striae from juvenile Comptopallium radula (Mollusca; Pectinidae) specimens collected live in New Caledonia. Bottom-water temperature and salinity were monitored in-situ throughout the study period. External shell striae form with a 2-day periodicity in this scallop, making it possible to estimate the date of precipitation for each calcite sample collected along a growth transect. The oxygen isotope composition of shell calcite ($\delta$18Oshell calcite) measured at almost weekly resolution on calcite accreted between August 2002 and July 2003 accurately tracks bottom-water temperatures. A new empirical paleotemperature equation for this scallop species relates temperature and $\delta$18Oshell calcite:t (° C) = 20.00 (± 0.61) - 3.66 (± 0.39) × ($\delta$18 Oshell calcite VPDB - $\delta$18 Owater VSMOW)The mean absolute accuracy of temperature estimated using this equation is 1.0 °C at temperatures between 20 and 30 °C. Uncertainties regarding the precise timing of CaCO3 deposition and the actual variations in $\delta$18Owater at our study sites probably contribute to this error. Comparison with a previously published empirical paleotemperature equation indicates that C. radula calcite is enriched in 18O by ∼0.7‰ relative to equilibrium. Given the direction of this offset and the lack of correlation between shell growth rate and $\delta$18Oshell calcite, this disequilibrium is unlikely to be related to kinetic isotope effects. We suggest that this enrichment reflects (1) a relatively low pH in the scallop's marginal extrapallial fluid (EPF), (2) an isotopic signature of the EPF different from that of seawater, or (3) Rayleigh fractionation during the biocalcification process. Relative changes in $\delta$18Oshell calcite reflect seawater temperature variability at this location and we suggest that the shell of C. radula may be useful as an archive of past seawater temperatures. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Polymers of intrinsic microporosity, e.g. PIM-1, are attractive materials for gas sepn. and energy development, which is ascribed mainly to their superior permeability. The H2 and CO2 permeability of PIM-1 is about 1300-4000 Barrer and 3000-8000 Barrer, resp. However, it has a relatively low H2/CO2 selectivity of 0.4-0.8. Different from the previous UV rearrangement approach, for the first time we report here a viable method to tune the intrinsic properties of PIM-1 blend membranes from being CO2-selective to H2-selective via blending with Matrimid and subsequent crosslinking the mixed matrix membrane with diamines at room temp. The ideal H2/CO2 selectivity of the membrane after modification by 2 h triethylenetetramine (TETA) improved dramatically from 0.4-0.8 to 9.6, with a H2 permeability of 395 Barrer. The modified membranes also show exceptional sepn. performance, surpassing the present upper bound for H2/CO2, H2/N2, H2/CH4 and O2/N2 sepns. Positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy (PALS) and Field emission SEM (FESEM) revealed that the diamine crosslinking successfully alters the membrane morphol. from a dense to a composite structure. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) anal. and sorption data confirmed that the modified membrane has a smaller d-spacing and a decrease in the diffusivity coeff. Our results also affirmed that the spatial structure, rather than the pKa value, of the diamine is the prevailing factor which governs the reactivity of diamines towards the PIM-1/Matrimid membrane due to the low concn. of cross-linkable polyimides distributing randomly in the polymer matrix. The fundamentals and knowledge gained throughout this study may facilitate the development of polymeric membranes for green H2 enrichment processes. [on SciFinder(R)]},

abstract = "Oxygen ion conducting Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3−δ hollow fiber membranes with o.d. 1.15mm and i.d. 0.71mm were fabricated using a sequence of extrusion, gelation, coating and sintering steps. The starting ceramic powder was synthesized by combined EDTA–citrate complexing followed by thermal treatment at 900°C. The powder was then dispersed in a polymer solution, and extruded through a spinerette. After gelation, an additional thin coating of the ceramic powder was applied on the fiber, and sintering was carried out at 1190°C to obtain the final ceramic membrane. The fibers were characterized by SEM, and tested for air separation at ambient pressure and at temperatures between 700 and 950°C. The maximum oxygen flux measured was 5.1mL/min/cm2 at 950°C."

\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
Throughout the writing of this dissertation I have received a great deal of support and assistance. I  would  first  like  to  thank  my  supervisor,  Dr.  M.  Gellar,  whose  expertise  was  invaluable  in  the formulating of the research topic and methodology in particular.

I would like to acknowledge my colleagues from my internship at Central P. for their wonderful collaboration. You supported me greatly and were always willing to help me. I would particularly like to single out my supervisor at Central P., Ms. P. Buffay. Phoebe, I want to thank you for your excellent  cooperation  and  for  all  of  the  opportunities  I  was  given  to  conduct  my  research  and further my dissertation at Central P.

I would also like to thank my tutors, Messrs. R. Geller and C. Bing, for their valuable guidance. You  provided  me  with  the  tools  that  I  needed  to  choose  the  right  direction  and  successfully complete my dissertation.

In addition, I would like to thank my parents for their wise counsel and sympathetic ear. You are always there for me. Finally, there are my friends, who were of great support in deliberating over our problems and findings, as well as providing happy distraction to rest my mind outside of my research.

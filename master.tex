\chapter*{Executive summary}
As government entities around the world seek to further develop their hydrogen economies with the aim of reducing their CO\textsubscript{2} emissions from the transport sector further adoption of fuel cell electric vehicles is expected. This thesis focused on developing a hydrogen impurity enrichment device using an optimised palladium based membrane as a method for low cost measurement of impurities to ISO 14687 standards. The composition of the palladium membrane was first optimised by screening of compositions using density functional theory. Compositions are simulated by placing ISO 14687 impurities on the surface and measuring their final energy level, with compositions which have a lower energy level with the impurity being deemed unsuitable. The best membrane compositions were then fabricated using a number of thin film deposition techniques including electroless plating and magnetron sputtering. The resulting micron thick palladium membranes were then subjected to two varieties of hydrogen impurities, carbonaceous and sulphurous, and their reactivity measured by using XPS and the change in hydrogen permeability when subjected to impurities. The result from this was that PdCuZr membranes were the least reactive and therefore the most suitable for hydrogen impurity enrichment where a membrane with low reactivity to impurities is required. Finally the resulting membrane was tested in an improved hydrogen impurity enrichment device which was set up with improved process control systems. The membrane was benchmarked against a commercial PdAgAu membrane and tested using an inert sample, sulphurous sample and for the first time a sample taken from a hydrogen refuelling station.


\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
Throughout the writing of this dissertation I have received a great deal of support and assistance. I  would  first  like  to  thank  my  supervisor,  Dr.  M.  Gellar,  whose  expertise  was  invaluable  in  the formulating of the research topic and methodology in particular.

I would like to acknowledge my colleagues from my internship at Central P. for their wonderful collaboration. You supported me greatly and were always willing to help me. I would particularly like to single out my supervisor at Central P., Ms. P. Buffay. Phoebe, I want to thank you for your excellent  cooperation  and  for  all  of  the  opportunities  I  was  given  to  conduct  my  research  and further my dissertation at Central P.

I would also like to thank my tutors, Messrs. R. Geller and C. Bing, for their valuable guidance. You  provided  me  with  the  tools  that  I  needed  to  choose  the  right  direction  and  successfully complete my dissertation.

In addition, I would like to thank my parents for their wise counsel and sympathetic ear. You are always there for me. Finally, there are my friends, who were of great support in deliberating over our problems and findings, as well as providing happy distraction to rest my mind outside of my research.
